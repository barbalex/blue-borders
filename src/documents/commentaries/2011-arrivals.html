	<p>The comments that follow refer to the year 2011 and are based on the chronology.</p>

	<h2>LIMITATIONS</h2>

	<p>The data on which the chronology is based are all secondhand. They originate from the websites of newspapers, news agencies, governments, IOs and NGOs. Although most of the information appears to be reliable, there are certain limitations. Whereas Lampedusa and Malta landings are regularly covered by the media, those along the southern coasts of Italy are not. This information is bound to be <strong>incomplete</strong>. Also, a careful look at the figures reveals various <strong>discrepancies</strong>. Some differences are minor, but many are major. If some of my figures are perhaps too low, those reported by others are often too high.</p>

	<h2>MINOR DISCREPANCIES</h2>

	<p>There are only minor differences between the data published by the <strong>International Organization for Migration</strong> (IOM) and my own. By 17 October, according to IOM,  25'935 persons fled by sea from Libya to Italy. My count is 24'601. The figures about <strong>Malta</strong> arrivals are even closer. My 31 October total is 1'526, that of IOM and of the <em>Times of Malta</em> is 1'530, all of them from Libya. The official Maltese figures also appear in the FRONTEX 2<sup>nd</sup> Quarter (Q2) Report.</p>

	<h2>MAJOR DISCREPANCIES</h2>

	<p>More problematic are the figures reported by the <strong>Italian government</strong>. Two examples are typical. Interior Minister Maroni speaks of 44'000 arrivals at Lampedusa and southern Italy by early July; my figure is 36'500. On 28 September the Interior Ministry, at a parliamentary hearing, mentions 60'656 arrivals by sea for all of Italy and 51'596 for the Pelagic Islands (or Lampedusa). My figures are 43'570 for Italy and 38'185 for Lampedusa – a difference of almost 40%! ANSA reported these figures on 28 September 2011, and they were then taken over by numerous news media.</p>

	<p><strong>FRONTEX</strong> numbers are equally problematic. In its <a href="http://www.frontex.europa.eu/situation_at_the_external_border/art25.html">First Quarter</a> (Q1) Report the EU body mentions 20'000 Lampedusa arrivals; my count is 14'100. The <a href="http://www.frontex.europa.eu/situation_at_the_external_border/art26.html">Q2 Report</a> speaks of 25'500 sea arrivals for all of Italy; my count is 18'000. For the <a href="http://www.frontex.europa.eu/situation_at_the_external_border/art28.html">3rd Quarter</a> FRONTEX reports 12'000 Lampedusa arrivals whereas my count is 8'000 - a 50% difference. In its <a href="FRONTEX%20publishes%20its%20Annual%20Risk%20Analysis%20for%202012%20%20FRONTEX%20...">Annual Risk Analysis</a> (published in April 2012) FRONTEX claims 64'000 "detections" in the Central Mediterranean; my figure is 47'000!</p>

	<p>The figures cited by the <strong>PACE Ad Hoc Sub-Committee </strong>investigating the situation at Lampedusa are also higher. PACE mentions 55'298 arrivals by 30 September, 4'000 more than the Italian government! My count is 38'185.</p>

	<p>Many organizations, including the PACE Committee, ANSA and the press, use figures computed by <strong>UNHCR</strong>. <em>La Repubblica</em>, for instance, quotes the organization on 10 September with 54'000 Lampedusa arrivals (26'000 from Tunisia, 28'000 from Libya). My figure for that date is around 37'000 (16'000 from Tunisia, 21'000 from Libya). For the entire year 2011 UNHCR speaks regularly of 56'000 Central Mediterranean arrivals. My count, as said, is 47'000. These figures are not as far off as those mentioned by FRONTEX but still sizeable and difficult to explain - at least for an outsider. So far I have been unable to find out how UNHCR figures are computed.</p>

	<p>The figures published by <strong>NGOs</strong> or blogs can be problematic as well. <em>Fortress Europe, </em>without indicating a definite source, claims that by the middle of August Italy saw 50'000 arrivals by sea, half of whom came from Tunisia, the other half from Libya! The quality of this information, too, is debatable.</p>

	<p>Throughout 2011, no reliable information about irregular migration emanated from the <strong>Tunisian</strong> and <strong>Libyan</strong> governments. We do not know the details of the 6 April 2011 agreement between Tunisia and Italy, and there is no discussion at all of Tunisian repatriations, especially after the September closure of Lampedusa.</p>

	<p>In Tunisia the situation only began to change when in December <a href="http://www.tap.info.tn/en/en/component/content/article/369-national-news-/8345--families-of-missing-q-harragasq-demand-truth.html">families</a> of missing "harragas", supported by a <a href="http://www.tap.info.tn/en/en/component/content/article/369-national-news-/8218-tunisian-forum-for-economic-and-social-rights-focuses-on-issue-of-illegal-migrants.html">human rights group</a>, demanded governmental action. On <a href="http://www.tap.info.tn/en/en/component/content/article/45/12037.html">16 March 2012</a>, the minister in charge of emigration, Houcine Jaziri, addressed the problem for a fist time publicly. By his count, over 30'000 (!) Tunisians left for Lampedusa after January 14.</p>

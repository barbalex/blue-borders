	<h2>SUMMARY STATEMENT</h2>

	<p>With only minor exceptions, the second part of 2012 is a continuation of the first. The same trends prevail. There are fewer <strong>crossings</strong> than in 2011, the number of <strong>accidents</strong> and <strong>victims</strong> has gone down, <strong>SAR</strong> and <strong>debarkation disputes</strong> have become less frequent. The geographical shift in <strong>arrivals</strong> – away from Lampedusa – continues. The pattern of <strong>departures</strong>, too, remains largely unchanged: Most migrants still leave from <strong>Libya</strong>. Diplomatic and political activities go on. <strong>Unilateral</strong> and <strong>bilateral</strong> efforts dominate but, as before, there is a lack of transparency and many aspects remain controversial. It is particularly true of Italy's relations with Libya and Tunisia.</p>

	<p>The EU's primary focus is still on <strong>border control</strong> (FRONTEX) and on <strong>asylum policy</strong> (Common European Asylum System, CEAS). Actual controls, or various FRONTEX <strong>operations</strong> at the borders of the Schengen area, are still surrounded by an almost complete air of secrecy. We also know very little about efforts to shape EUROSUR and to define and to implement <strong>'smart borders'</strong>. The European Asylum Support Office (EASO) has had a slow start and, so far, is of marginal importance. And, finally, the process of strengthening CEAS is cumbersome and slow. For Brussels the Schengen area was less important than the shaping of the Fiscal and the Banking Union.</p>

	<h2>FEWER ARRIVALS</h2>

	<p><a href="index.php/events-2012/arrivals-2012">Arrivals</a> were down during the first six months of 2012, and the trend continued during the second six months. All told, 12'400 migrants landed this year, almost <strong>four times less</strong> than in 2011. As usual, the arrival pattern was uneven. Two thirds (or around 8'300) arrived during the second part of the year, compared to approximately 4'100 that came during the first six months. The increase is <strong>seasonal</strong> in character and largely determined by favorable weather conditions.</p>

	<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="../images/2012/graph_1.png" border="0" alt="graph 1" /></p>

	<h2>SHIFT IN DESTINATIONS</h2>

	<p>The shift in <a href="index.php/events-2012/arrivals-2012">destinations</a> continues as well. <strong>Southern Italy</strong> (defined as Sicily, Calabria and Apulia) is now the main area of arrival, with 5'822 landings for the entire year. <strong>Lampedusa</strong> is second with 4'622 disembarkations and a distribution that, again, is uneven. 849 migrants arrived on the island during the first part of the year, 3'773 during the second. The reason is the late inflow of 2'207 sub-Saharan Africans from Libya. They arrived from October to December, a dangerous season for travelling all the way from Libya to Lampedusa. <strong>Malta</strong> saw 1'891 arrivals, up from 1'566 in 2011. The increase was moderate and did not amount to what some Maltese feared would be a 'dramatic summer' (<a href="http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20120613/local/Too-early-to-sound-alarm-on-migration.424042">ToM 13.6.</a>).</p>

	<h2>CONTINUITY IN DEPARTURES</h2>

	<p><strong>Libya</strong>, as mentioned, is still the major country of <a href="index.php/events-2012/arrivals-2012">departure</a>. Of the 12'335 boat people that crossed the sea in 2012, more than half (or 6'403) left from Libya. 1'693 arrived during the first six months, 4'710 during the second six months. Practically all are sub-Saharan Africans, mostly from Somalia, Eritrea, Sudan and South Sudan. Libya is an important <strong>transit route </strong>(<a href="http://www.frontex.europa.eu/assets/Publications/Risk_Analysis/FRAN_Q4_2012.pdf">FRAN Q4 2012</a>), which is not true of <strong>Tunisia</strong>. Of the 1'895 migrants arriving from this country almost all were Tunisian nationals. And, compared to 2011, the number of embarkations decreased sharply. With fewer than 2'000 arrivals Tunisia is now the least important of the three departure areas.</p>

	<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="../images/2012/graph_4.png" border="0" alt="graph 4" /></p>

	<h2>INCREASE IN DEPARTURES</h2>

	<p>Compared to 2011, there was a significant <strong>increase</strong> in <a href="index.php/events-2012/arrivals-2012">arrivals</a>from the 'East'. 4'037 migrants landed this year, 1'335 during the first half, 2'702 during the second half. The total for 2011 was 2'804. The 'East' is now the second most important departure region, and most landings are in Apulia and Calabria. The reason for the increase is political instability in countries like Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria. But some also leave from Pakistan and Bangladesh. An effort to determine national affiliation is undertaken by FRONTEX and published in its quarterly reports (<a href="http://www.frontex.europa.eu/assets/Publications/Risk_Analysis/FRAN_Q1_2012.pdf">FRAN Q1</a>, <a href="http://www.frontex.europa.eu/assets/Publications/Risk_Analysis/FRAN_Q2_2012_.pdf">FRAN Q2</a>, <a href="http://www.frontex.europa.eu/assets/Publications/Risk_Analysis/FRAN_Q3_2012.pdf">FRAN Q3</a>, <a href="http://www.frontex.europa.eu/assets/Publications/Risk_Analysis/FRAN_Q4_2012.pdf">FRAN Q4</a>). There is also a marked increase of <strong>Egyptians</strong>. As FRONTEX shows, most of them arrive in Apulia and Calabria but, interestingly enough, some also make it to Sicily.</p>

	<h2>FEWER VICTIMS</h2>

	<p>The number of <a href="index.php/events-2012/4th-quarter">victims</a>, like that of total arrivals, also <strong>decreased</strong>. For 2011, my count was 1'182 casualties; this year's number is 309. It is a <strong>four-fold reduction,</strong> paralleling the drop in arrivals. There were 108 victims during the first half of the year and 201 during the second half. Of the roughly 300 victims about 230 are said to be <strong>missing</strong> while 80 have <strong>died</strong>. These figures are imprecise and must be regarded with caution. Last year, some NGOs mentioned between 1'500 and 2'000 casualties, while my count – as stated – was 1'182. Figures about missing are usually based on survivor reports and less reliable than figures about dead that, in most instances, rest on an actual body count.</p>

	<h2>FOUR MAJOR ACCIDENTS</h2>

	<p>Two-thirds of this year's victims, or 226 of the 309, were the result of four <strong>major accidents</strong>. There was a first calamity on 28 January off the coast of <strong>Libya</strong> that claimed the lives of 54 Somalis (<a href="http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20120129/local/15-dead-40-missing-as-migrants-boat-capsizes-off-libya.404242">ToM 29.1.</a>). Three more tragedies occurred during the second part of the year. One happened on 10 July off <strong>Tunisia</strong> with 54 Somali victims (<a href="http://www.repubblica.it/solidarieta/immigrazione/2012/07/10/news/54_morti_in_mare_dalla_libia_un_superstite_racconta_di_54_morti_in_mare_nel_tentativo_di_giungere_in_italia_dalla_libia-38847692/index.html?ref=search">Rep 10.7.</a>). Another took place on 27 August at the <strong>Libyan-Egyptian</strong> maritime border with 40 casualties, probably East Africans (<a href="http://www.libyaherald.com/2012/08/30/reports-of-dozens-more-drowned-in-attempt-to-reach-europe/">LH 30.8.</a>). The largest accident occurred on 6 September 10 NM off <strong>Lampedusa</strong> involving 79 Tunisians (<a href="http://palermo.repubblica.it/cronaca/2012/09/07/news/lampedusa_naufragio_di_un_barcone_trasportava_centinaia_di_migranti-42092208/index.html?ref=search">Rep 7.9.</a>). We know relatively little about the three North African incidents, but there is some information about the Lampedusa disaster. According to survivors 130 migrants were packed onto an old 10 m vessel; an ambiguous distress message was received at Palermo in the early evening hours; the boat must have sunk rapidly because the 56 Tunisians rescued (by GC and NATO units) were adrift at sea; no traces of the distressed vessel could be found, which is rather uncommon. The Tunisian and Italian authorities started an investigation (<a href="http://www.tap.info.tn/en/index.php/politics2/176-joint-tunisian-italian-investigation-commission-and-reviewing-of-agreement-on-illegal-migration">TAP 13.9</a>.). So far no results have been published.</p>

	<h2>PROBLEMATIC RESCUES</h2>

	<p>The September 6 tragedy shows that some rescues are problematic. Vessels are often overloaded and poorly equipped. Shortages of gasoline, water and food are common. Migrants suffer physically and psychologically. Tensions and quarrels are frequent. Rescues, in such circumstances, are no simple matter. Panics and stampedes turn transfers into dangerous ventures. To move people from vulnerable migrant vessels to large commercial ships is particularly demanding. On 15 August, for example, 157 sub-Saharan Africans on two small dinghies had to be rescued. 60 were taken aboard by a merchant vessel, 100 by the Maltese coast guard. Two migrants disappeared in transfer, two died on an AFM patrol boat and two after arrival (<a href="http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20120819/local/-They-rescued-me-from-the-dead-but-I-wish-I-had-died-with-my-wife-.433380">ToM 19.8.</a>). Rescues can end tragically, even when handled professionally. But criminal behavior may also be involved. On 31 December, two Tunisians drowned off the coast of Sicily, 30 made it ashore (<a href="http://www.ansa.it/web/notizie/regioni/sicilia/2012/12/31/Sbarco-Trapanese-forse-2-dispersi_8014132.html">ANSA 31.12.</a>). Some survivors told the Italian authorities that the 'facilitators', trying to escape, had simply thrown them overboard!</p>

	<h2>SUCCESSFUL RESCUES</h2>

	<p>It is a fact, however, that most <strong>rescue operations</strong> succeed. On 12 and 23 October, a total of 530 sub-Saharan migrants were rescued by Italian coast guard units and taken to Lampedusa (<a href="http://palermo.repubblica.it/cronaca/2012/10/12/news/lampedusa_soccorsi_109_migranti_erano_su_un_gommone_in_avaria-44367902/?ref=search">Rep 12.10.</a>, <a href="http://www.corriere.it/notizie-ultima-ora/Cronache_e_politica/Immigrazione-oltre-220-soccorsi-mare/24-10-2012/1-A_003177006.shtml">CdS 24.10.</a>). On 9 November, 246 Africans were brought to Malta, a respectable performance given the limited AFM offshore capabilities (<a href="http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20121110/local/afm-s-efforts-to-save-lives-commended.444787">ToM 10.11.</a>). On 24 November, the Italians took 235 Africans to Lampedusa; another 450 followed on 15 December (<a href="http://corrieredelmezzogiorno.corriere.it/palermo/notizie/cronaca/2012/24-novembre-2012/lampedusa-sbarcati-235-migranti-2112861150679.shtml">CdM 24.11.</a>, <a href="http://palermo.repubblica.it/cronaca/2012/12/15/news/lampedusa_salvati_oltre_400_migranti-48782989/">Rep 15.12.</a>). On 28 December, ANSA reported that in 2012 Italy had rescued 6'000 migrants in distress at sea (<a href="http://www.corriere.it/notizie-ultima-ora/Cronache_e_politica/Guardia-Costiera-2012-anno-difficile/28-12-2012/1-A_004408708.shtml">CdS 28.12.</a>). The claim is difficult to substantiate because, at times, it is hard to distinguish between <strong>rescues </strong>and<strong> interceptions</strong>. But, given the 10'000 arrivals at Italy's southern shores, the figure may not be too far off.</p>

	<h2>MORE SAR COOPERATION</h2>

	<p>Not a single SAR dispute flared up between <strong>Italy and Malta</strong> during the second part of 2012. The opposite is true. There were several instances of successful SAR cooperation (<a href="http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20120729/world/Italy-rescues-75-African-migrants-from-dinghy.430554">ToM 29.7.</a>, <a href="http://www.afm.gov.mt/NewsDetails?l=1&amp;nid=1727&amp;cid=82">ToM 21.8.</a>, <a href="Lampedusa%20still">CdS 7.10.</a>). Two operations took place in Libyan waters (<a href="http://www.afm.gov.mt/NewsDetails?l=1&amp;nid=1803&amp;cid=82">AFM 24.10.</a>, <a href="http://www.afm.gov.mt/NewsDetails?l=1&amp;nid=1831&amp;cid=82">AFM 6.11.</a>), and in another the Libyan coast guard was involved as well (<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-19016426">BBC 27.7.</a>). Cooperation is important because some SAR situations are puzzling. In early July, 6 Somalis were rescued by the Maltese, but the remaining 60 refused and headed for Sicily (<a href="http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20120707/local/six-migrants-rescued-60-refuse-help.427565">ToM 8.7.</a>). Or, as happens regularly, some migrants pass through Maltese waters, ask the AFM for gasoline, and then insist on continuing to Italy. Are these instances of 'distress at sea' in conformity with international law? In September, Italy and Malta signed an agreement to improve SAR cooperation (<a href="http://www.ansamed.info/ansamed/it/notizie/rubriche/politica/2012/09/12/Immigrazione-Terzi-Malta-priorita-salvare-vite-innocenti_7464767.html">ANSAmed 12.9.</a>). Whether it will settle the thorny issue of disembarkation, we do not know.</p>

	<h2>LAMPEDUSA</h2>

	<p>Once Lampedusa was declared an 'unsafe port' in September of last year, arrivals were extremely low. The trend continued during the first part of 2012. It changed abruptly, however, with the arrival of over 2'000 sub-Saharan Africans during the last quarter. That, once again, <strong>strained the capacities</strong> of the reception center rebuilt for 300 persons. Over 800 had to be accommodated in November and early December (<a href="http://www.ansa.it/web/notizie/regioni/sicilia/2012/11/29/Immigrazione-10-trasferiti-Lampedusa_7874940.html">ANSA 29.11.</a>). Thanks to two new actors, Giusi Nicolini, now mayor of Lampedusa, and Anna Maria Cancellieri, PM Monti's Minister of Justice, an emergency comparable to that of last year could be avoided.</p>

	<h2>ITALY</h2>

	<p>Unfortunately, other Italian problems remain unsolved. It remains uncertain when Lampedusa will once more become a port that is safe to land. And we still know next to nothing about the country's migration deals with <strong>Tunisia and Libya</strong>. In October, Italian officials visited <strong>Tunis</strong> to discuss the development of a 'comprehensive approach to illegal migration' (<a href="Prime%20Minister%20Hamadi%20Jebali%20and%20Italy's%20ambassador%20in%20Tunis%20Pietro%20Binassi%20looked%20Wednesday%20at%20means%20to%20start%20regular%20consultations%20between%20the%20Tunisian%20and%20Italian%20governments%20on%20illegal%20">TAP 10.10.</a>). No details were published. There is also no official information about the repatriation of Tunisian 'harragas' – neither from Rome nor from Tunis. Relations with <strong>Libya</strong> are inscrutable, too. In September, Italy and Libya agreed to re-negotiate the migration arrangement signed on 3 April 2011 (<a href="http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20120913/local/Italy-renegotiates-migrant-arrangement-with-Libya.436686">ToM 13.9.</a>). As a follow-up FM Terzi visited Tripoli to discuss matters of migration and security (<a href="http://www.ansamed.info/ansamed/it/notizie/rubriche/politica/2012/11/06/Italia-Libia-Terzi-flussi-immigrazione-preoccupano-entrambi_7748434.html">ANSAmed 6.11.</a>). Nothing of substance was ever communicated. Many questions remain. What exactly is meant by 'security'? The push-back policy of earlier years seems to have ended, but what are the new arrangements? There are good reasons why Amnesty International, in a petition with 28'000 signatures, asked the Italian government to cancel the secret Libya agreement of April 2011 (<a href="http://www.repubblica.it/solidarieta/diritti-umani/2012/10/19/news/immigrati_consegnate_28_mila_firme_cancellate_l_accordo_con_la_libia-44874275/?ref=search">Rep 19.10.</a>). Concern about Italian-Libyan relations was also voiced by François Crépeau, the UN Rapporteur on Human Rights (<a href="http://migrantsatsea.wordpress.com/2012/11/27/un-special-rapporteur-on-hr-of-migrants-expresses-concern-over-italy-libya-cooperation-on-migration/">MaS 27.11.</a>).</p>

	<h2>MALTA</h2>

	<p>Practically all migrants arriving in Malta depart from Libya, reason enough for the two governments to be in touch. In contrast to Italy, however, there seems to be <strong>no formal agreement</strong>. But contacts exist. In July, a Libyan official visited Malta to discuss irregular migration and military assistance (<a href="They%20centred%20on%20the%20importance%20of%20closer%20ties%20between%20Malta%20and%20Libya%20on%20border%20control%20and%20illegal%20immigration%20and%20assistance%20which%20the%20AFM%20can%20give%20the%20Libyan%20authorities.">ToM 5.7.</a>). In December, PM Gonzi visited Tripoli to talk about energy and migration (<a href="http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20121207/local/pm-hopes-for-energy-agreement-with-libya.448628">ToM 7.12.</a>). No details were published. But <strong>military cooperation</strong> got started. Toward the end of August, a contingent of 46 AFM personnel were in Libya to conduct a two-day exercise with local forces (<a href="http://www.afm.gov.mt/NewsDetails?l=1&amp;nid=1746&amp;cid=87">AFM 28.9.</a>). In October, two training courses attended by Libyan officers were held in Malta: A Basic Boarding Course and a SAR Coordination Course (<a href="http://www.afm.gov.mt/NewsDetails?l=1&amp;nid=1797&amp;cid=83">AFM 15.10.</a>, <a href="http://www.afm.gov.mt/NewsDetails?l=1&amp;nid=1810&amp;cid=83">AFM 27.10.</a>). Malta is also beefing up its <strong>SAR capabilities</strong> – with EU funding. The AFM acquired two fixed-wing aircraft and four inshore patrol boats (<a href="http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20120926/local/AFM-shows-off-latest-search-and-rescue-craft.438410">ToM 26.9.</a>). Finally, and important for Malta, the <strong>resettlement</strong> of East Africans (assisted by the US and by EUREMA) continues to function (<a href="http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20121210/local/20-migrants-leave-for-the-us.449013">ToM 10.12.</a>, <a href="http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20121212/local/six.449328">ToM 12.12.</a>). All told there were 420 resettlements in 2012 (<a href="http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20121218/local/four-migrants-leave-for-portugal.450117">ToM 18.12.</a>). In July, <a href="http://www.easo.europa.eu/documents/EASO_fact_finding.pdf">EASO</a> published a review of EUREMA activities.</p>

	<h2>CHANGING TUNISIA</h2>

	<p>Although involved in a difficult process of political transition, Tunisian <strong>society</strong> has become more open and pluralistic. Irregular migration and the fate of 'harragas' are topics increasingly discussed by NGOs, the media – and even by the government. During the second half of this year, there were three reports about <strong>SAR operations</strong> conducted by local forces (<a href="http://www.tunisienumerique.com/tunisie-immigration-clandestine-3-cadavres-repeches-par-la-garde-cotiere-de-monastir/133202">TN 6.7.</a>, <a href="http://www.tap.info.tn/en/en/component/content/article/45/16789.html">TAP 15.7.</a>, <a href="http://www.tap.info.tn/en/index.php/national-news/2919-seven-illegal-emigrants-rescued-off-ras-maamoura">TAP 26.11.</a>). There were also reports about the prevention of four <strong>irregular departures</strong> (<a href="http://www.tap.info.tn/en/en/component/content/article/369-national-news-/16632-13-failed-attempts-last-june-.html">TAP 10.7.</a>, <a href="http://www.tunisienumerique.com/tunisie-de-jeunes-candidats-a-limmigration-arretes-a-bizerte/138127">TN 7.8.</a>, <a href="http://www.tap.info.tn/en/en/component/content/article/369-national-news-/18590-coastguards-thwart-two-illegal-immigration-attempts.html">TAP 11.9.</a>, <a href="http://www.tap.info.tn/en/en/regions/18862-medenine-illegal-emigration-attempt-to-italy-foiled.html">TAP 18.9.</a>). If we are to believe the Ministry of the Interior, in September the National Guard thwarted 14 illegal migration attempts involving 459 persons, including 160 foreigners (<a href="http://www.tap.info.tn/en/index.php/politic/1253-national-guard-thwarts-14-attempts-at-illegal-emigration-in-september-interior">TAP 5.10.</a>). Such information is rare and unsystematic, however. There is no news at all from the coast guard unit attached to the Department of Defense. <strong>Migrant smuggling</strong> also makes the news. In September, 18 Tunisians were arrested for trafficking 'harragas' (<a href="http://ffm-online.org/2012/09/23/tunesien-18-personen-als-schlepper-verhaftet-2/">FFM 23.9.</a>). And in July a Tunisian was sentenced to 15 years in prison for involvement in an April 2011 accident that caused the death of 19 nationals (<a href="http://www.letemps.com.tn/article-67731.html">LT 10.7.</a>).</p>

	<h2>FATE OF 'HARRAGAS'</h2>

	<p>The <strong>6 September tragedy</strong> received considerable attention, both by the Tunisian government and by the press. It all started, once again, with the families of <strong>missing 'harragas'</strong> protesting about a lack of information (<a href="http://www.tunisienumerique.com/tunisie-appel-a-une-journee-internationale-de-deuil-en-faveur-des-morts-et-disparus-au-large-de-lampedusa/143011">TN 10.9.</a>, <a href="http://www.tunisienumerique.com/rassemblement-ce-soir-au-centre-de-tunis-en-memoire-des-victimes-et-des-disparus-du-naufrage-de-lampedusa/143193">TN 11.9.</a>). The government then began to act. PM Jebali announced the formation of an investigating committee and sent State Secretary Jaziri to Italy (<a href="http://www.tunisienumerique.com/tunisie-regrets-et-condoleances-hamadi-jebali-aux-familles-des-disparus-dans-le-naufrage-de-lampedusa/142993">TN 10.9.</a>). Foreign Minister Abdessalem agreed to meet families of the missing 'harragas', and his ministry published the names of 56 migrants that were rescued (<a href="http://www.tunisienumerique.com/tunisie-rafik-abdessalem-rencontrera-les-familles-des-naufrages-de-lampedusa/143229">TN 11.9.</a>, <a href="http://www.tunisienumerique.com/tunisie-publication-de-la-liste-complete-des-56-rescapes-du-naufrage-et-leurs-photos/143283">TN 11.9.</a>). A few days later, Tunisia and Italy agreed to form a joint commission of investigation (<a href="Tunisia%20and%20Italy%20agreed%20to%20set%20up%20a%20joint%20investigation%20commission%20on%20the%20Lampedusa%20tragedy%20and%20review%20of%20the%20bilateral%20co-operation%20agreement%20on%20fight%20against%20illegal%20migration">TAP 14.9.</a>). On 26 September, the authorities arrested a <strong>migrant smuggler</strong> accused of organizing the September voyage (<a href="http://www.tunisienumerique.com/tunisie-arrestation-du-passeur-du-bateau-de-limmigration-clandestine-naufrage-lampedusa/146378">TN 26.9.</a>). At the <strong>5+5 Summit</strong> in Malta President Marzouki proposed the formation of a <strong>task force</strong> to review SAR cooperation and to propose improvements (<a href="http://www.maltatoday.com.mt/en/newsdetails/news/national/North-African-leaders-laud-Malta-at-close-of-successful-5-5-meeting-20121006">MT 6.10.</a>). So far there is no news about the results of these steps. A <a href="http://nawaat.org/portail/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/rapport_immigrant-2013_2.pdf">report</a> dealing with the 'harragas' issue in some detail was published in March 2013 by FTDES, a Tunisian NGO.</p>

	<h2>LIBYAN BORDER CONTROL</h2>

	<p>Libya is also in the midst of political transition (<a href="http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20120810/world/libyan-president-appointed.432219">ToM 10.8.</a>, <a href="http://www.tripolipost.com/articledetail.asp?c=1&amp;i=9312">TP 14.10.</a>). The interim government faces a number of serious challenges. One is internal security and a need to gain <strong>territorial control</strong>. The grip on land and sea borders in particular has to be improved. A number of steps point in this direction. Around the middle of December, Libya announced the temporary closure of its borders with Niger, Chad, Sudan and Algeria (<a href="http://www.libyaherald.com/2012/12/18/libyan-fighter-jets-hit-suspected-smugglers-in-southern-militarised-zone/">LH 18.12.</a>). On 23 December, the government assumed control over the migrant detention center in the southern town of Sebha, a region of frequent unrest (<a href="http://www.libyaherald.com/2012/12/23/libyas-south-migrants-journeys/">LH 23.12.</a>). A week later, the armed forces installed new check points along the Egyptian border (<a href="http://www.libyaherald.com/2012/12/30/army-sets-up-new-checkpoint-between-jalu-and-kufra/">LH 30.12.</a>). It is difficult to say, of course, how effective all these measures are. The <strong>European Union</strong> has also entered the scene. In July, the <strong>Foreign Affairs Council</strong> declared its readiness to assist Libya in the area of border management (<a href="http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/EN/foraff/131990.pdf">EUC 23.7.</a>). Toward the end of the year, there were reports about actual discussions and the signature of an EU-Libya MOU covering police and military matters (<a href="http://ffm-online.org/2012/11/23/libyen-wird-polizeilicher-vorposten-der-eu/">FFM 22.11.</a>, <a href="http://www.libyaherald.com/2012/11/30/eu-and-libya-discuss-border-security/">LH 30.11.</a>). In December, PM Zeidan discussed border security while visiting Algeria, Niger, Chad and Sudan (<a href="http://www.libyaherald.com/2012/12/14/security-at-heart-of-relations-with-neighbours-says-zeidan/">LH 14.12.</a>). Tunisia was also approached (<a href="http://www.libyaherald.com/2012/12/15/libya-discusses-border-security-with-tunisia/">LH 15.12.</a>). As usual, detailed information about these measures is unavailable.</p>

	<h2>MIGRANT SMUGGLING</h2>

	<p>The lack of territorial control enables Libyan <strong>'facilitators'</strong> to operate without much risk (<a href="http://www.frontex.europa.eu/assets/Publications/Risk_Analysis/FRAN_Q4_2012.pdf">FRAN Q4 2012</a>). They do so inside the country and across its land and sea borders – often to the detriment of migrants. As shown earlier, interviews conducted by researchers show that they are regularly exploited, physically and financially. Newspaper stories tend to confirm this (<a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/MDE19/020/2012/en">ToM 18.11.</a>). The plight of migrants is also documented in an investigation done by Amnesty International (<a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/MDE19/020/2012/en">AI 13.11.</a>). And, as a UN inspector reports, the situation in Libya's south seems to be particularly bad (<a href="http://www.libyaherald.com/2012/11/25/un-team-investigates-development-and-illegal-immigration-in-the-south/">LH 25.11.</a>). Improvements are necessary, but policing alone will not do. Migrants have to be treated in accordance with UNHCR rules which, of course, presupposes control over migrant smugglers and a measure of good governance. 'Facilitators' have a more difficult time in <strong>Italy</strong>. During the second part of 2012, according to media reports, the authorities arrested smugglers in at least a dozen cases. There was also a report of an Italian court sentencing two Greeks for involvement in the death of a migrant in July 2010 (<a href="http://www.ansa.it/web/notizie/regioni/calabria/2012/10/24/Immigrato-mori-condannati-scafisti_7684529.html">ANSA 24.10.</a>).</p>

	<h2>EU ASYLUM POLICY</h2>

	<p>The EU intended to strengthen the Common European Asylum System (CEAS) by the end of 2012. Several steps were taken, but no final agreement was reached. The legislative Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (<strong>LIBE</strong>) discussed a range of asylum-related matters on two occasions (<a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/pressroom/content/20120709IPR48499/html/Asylum-policy-call-for-fair-shares-and-solidarity">LIBE 11.7.</a>, <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/pressroom/content/20120917IPR51500/html/Asylum-seekers-no-transfers-to-EU-countries-unable-to-cope">EUPL 19.9.</a>). <strong>Parliament</strong> itself debated CEAS, including the question of resettlement (<a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/pressroom/content/20120907IPR50814/html/Asylum-policy-MEPs-call-for-fair-shares-and-solidarity">EUPL 11.9.</a>). The October <strong>JHA Council</strong> also dealt with asylum policy. On the agenda were issues like reception conditions, Dublin II and EURODAC (<a href="http://www.frontex.europa.eu/news/first-global-abc-conference-exhibition-38Dqic">EUC 25./26.10.</a>). As said, the effort failed. There was some progress, however, on other matters related to asylum. The <strong>European Court of Justice</strong> decided that Parliament must be involved in the formulation of the Schengen Border Code (<a href="http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&amp;docid=121662&amp;pageIndex=0&amp;doclang=EN&amp;mode=lst&amp;dir=&amp;occ=first&amp;part=1&amp;cid=1287005">EUCJ 5.9.</a>, <a href="http://migrantsatsea.wordpress.com/2012/09/10/eu-court-of-justice-annuls-frontex-sea-borders-rule-eu-parliamentary-approval-required/">MaS 10.9.</a>). Also in September, FRONTEX appointed its first human rights officer (<a href="http://www.frontex.europa.eu/news/management-board-designates-fundamental-rights-officer-zqofRR">FRONTEX 27.9.</a>). And, in November, LIBE approved legislation to upgrade the human rights standards applying to EUROSUR (<a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/pressroom/content/20121126IPR56410/html/EUROSUR-border-surveillance-must-help-save-migrants'-lives-say-MEPs">EUPL 27.11.</a>).</p>

	<h2>EU BORDER CONTROL</h2>

	<p>FRONTEX's primary function is to coordinate national measures of border control. But it can also launch its own initiatives. The instruments employed are a combination of traditional control <strong>operations</strong> and modern <strong>high-tech systems</strong>. In the Central Mediterranean, so far, conventional measures dominate. More precisely, FRONTEX organizes <strong>Joint Operations</strong> to control the inflow of migrants and, if necessary, to engage in search and rescue missions. Official information about these operations is minimal and imprecise. The <a href="http://www.frontex.europa.eu/operations/archive-of-accomplished-operations">FRONTEX website</a> mentions <strong>JO Hermes</strong> (Central Mediterranean) and <strong>JO Aeneas</strong> (Ionian and Adriatic Sea) with only a few words and declares that both ended in March 2012. But in FRONTEX's own <a href="http://www.frontex.europa.eu/assets/Publications/Risk_Analysis/FRAN_Q2_2012_.pdf">FRAN Q2 Report</a>(April-June 2012) we read that from July to October of this year they were still in existence. And, according to <a href="http://www.frontex.europa.eu/assets/Publications/Risk_Analysis/FRAN_Q4_2012.pdf">FRAN Q4</a>, JO Hermes will continue till the end of January 2013. The same uncertainty surrounds <strong>JO Poseidon</strong>. Meant to function between Greece and Turkey, the <a href="http://www.frontex.europa.eu/operations/archive-of-accomplished-operations">website</a> lists this operation for the year 2009. But a UN report indicates that the mission was operative in 2012 and, furthermore, had expanded to cover the Greek-Italian border (<a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=12858&amp;LangID=E">OHCHR 3.12.</a>).</p>

	<h2>FRONTEX REPATRIATION</h2>

	<p>FRONTEX also manages <strong>return operations</strong>. Such missions, from what we know, consist mainly of <strong>repatriation flights</strong> for migrants that fail to get asylum in a Schengen country. As shown earlier, FRONTEX does not mention the number of flights per operation. Its <a href="http://www.frontex.europa.eu/operations/archive-of-accomplished-operations">website</a> merely indicates the country of destination and the 'host' (or departure) country. According to this list there were 24 'operations' in 2012, 25 the year before, and 37 in 2010. The information available, once again, is minimal. The same applies to the organization's <a href="http://www.frontex.europa.eu/assets/Publications/Risk_Analysis/FRAN_Q2_2012_.pdf">FRAN Q2 Report</a> and its reference to repatriations. It is useful to hear that throughout the quarter "Italy and Tunisia cooperated efficiently to repatriate Tunisian nationals". But it is exactly about this operation that we would like to know more.</p>

	<h2>SCHENGEN'S HIGH-TECH BORDERS</h2>

	<p>A major high-tech effort run by FRONTEX is the European External Border Surveillance System (<a href="http://www.frontex.europa.eu/eurosur">EUROSUR</a>). The project's primary purpose is to <strong>coordinate</strong> national border control systems. The program was initiated in 2008, and the geographic focus is mainly on the Mediterranean and North Africa. EUROSUR is accompanied by a series of <strong>high-tech initiatives</strong>, but it is difficult to gain an exact overview. One effort mentioned by the press is the development of drones (<a href="http://www.maltatoday.com.mt/en/newsdetails/news/national/AFM-interested-in-EU-sponsored-drones-for-migrant-surveillance-at-sea-20120728">MT 29.7.</a>, <a href="http://migrantsatsea.wordpress.com/2012/08/08/malta-expresses-interest-in-use-of-drones-for-migrant-surveillance-at-sea/">MaS 8.8.</a>). A particularly ambitious project is <a href="http://www.perseus-fp7.eu/">PERSEUS</a>. Its goal is to <strong>integrate</strong> existing systems of maritime border control into one, to develop something like a system-of-systems. Finally, EUROSUR invests heavily in <strong>research and development</strong>, some of which is financed via the EU's 7<sup>th</sup> Framework Program (FP7). Some of these projects are handled by defense contractors. Reason enough for some NGOs to speak of a growing 'securitization' or 'militarization' of Schengen borders.</p>

	<h2>SMART BORDERS</h2>

	<p>In the fall of 2011, the Commission suggested the development of <strong>'smart borders'</strong> (<a href="http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/news/intro/docs/20111025/20111025-680_en.pdf">EUCOM</a>). The concept refers mainly (but not exclusively) to a set of measures useful for the <strong>identification</strong> of persons crossing the outer Schengen borders. Some instruments already exist. Border control officers make regular (and successful) use of the Schengen Information System (<strong>SIS</strong>), the Visa Information System (<strong>VIS</strong>) and <strong>EURODAC</strong>, a program to register fingerprints (<a href="http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/news/intro/docs/20111025/20111025-680_en.pdf">EUCOM</a>). Two additional systems are in the making. To permit the tracing of 'overstayers', the largest group of irregular migrants, the Commission proposes an Entry/Exit System (<strong>EES</strong>). And, to facilitate the movement of frequent (and regular) visitors, the Commission envisages a Registered Travelers Programme (<strong>RTP</strong>) (<a href="http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/news/intro/docs/20111025/20111025-680_en.pdf">EUCOM</a>).</p>

	<h2>INFORMATION SOURCES</h2>

	<p>The flow of publicly available information from <strong>Tunisia</strong> and <strong>Libya</strong> has improved but is still irregular and imprecise. The main problem are the governments rather than the media. Officials are not (yet) in the habit of systematically reporting about irregular migration and blue border issues. The situation in <strong>Malta</strong> is different. Both the government and the media provide data that are useful and reliable. During the second half of 2012, the AFM re-did their <a href="http://www.afm.gov.mt/home?l=1">website</a> and now inform in some detail about SAR operations. The figures about 2012 arrivals mentioned by PM Gonzi in Parliament square completely with those I managed to obtain from the press and from the AFM (<a href="http://www.maltatoday.com.mt/en/newsdetails/news/national/1-567-migrants-came-to-Malta-in-10-months-20121106">MT 6.11.</a>).</p>

	<p>In <strong>Italy</strong> the situation is less satisfactory. The media cover blue-border events as reliably as they can. <em>La Repubblica</em> contains detailed stories about the fate of migrants and about SAR operations. But government news is scarce. The ministries in Rome transmit figures to FRONTEX in Warsaw – but do not make them public. The two major coast guard agencies, GC and GdF, run extensive web-pages that, unfortunately, contain no information about actual operations.</p>

	<p><strong>To conclude</strong>: The over-all information situation about blue-border events is unsatisfactory. It is true for the Central Mediterranean but, as the EU Commission says in its Biannual Schengen Report, it applies to irregular migration as a whole – and most particularly to maritime migration (<a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-12-1256_en.htm">EUCOM 23.11.</a>).</p>

	<h2>'CENTRAL MEDITERRANEAN'</h2>

	<p>The Central Mediterranean, as defined on this website, includes (on the European side) Malta, Lampedusa, Sicily, Calabria and Apulia. FRONTEX (at least in its quarterly FRAN reports) operates with a <a href="http://www.frontex.europa.eu/assets/Publications/Risk_Analysis/FRAN_Q3_2012.pdf">narrower definition</a> that excludes Calabria and Apulia. That, as I show below, has to be taken into account when comparing arrival figures. Both definitions are somewhat problematic because, when it comes to migration, it is impossible to neatly separate the Central from Eastern Mediterranean. Boatpeople arriving from the 'East' cross both seas and usually end up in Apulia and Calabria. But some Egyptians travel along the Libyan coast and end up in Sicily. FRONTEX, when counting Central Mediterranean arrivals, excludes the former but includes the latter. The wider definition, in this case, is more useful. It also has the advantage of including all of the Ionian Sea – which is definitely part of the Central Mediterranean.</p>

	<h2>COMPARING NUMBERS</h2>

	<p>FRONTEX, in its <a href="http://www.frontex.europa.eu/assets/Publications/Risk_Analysis/Annual_Risk_Analysis_2013.pdf">Annual Risk Analysis 2013</a>, publishes the figures for 2012. The report, for the first time, mentions the numbers for both Sicily/Lampedusa/Malta <em>and</em> for Calabria/Apulia thereby facilitating a realistic comparison. All told FRONTEX lists 15'151 'detections', while my count is 12'335 'arrivals'. The FRONTEX figure, as usual, is higher. The difference is a hefty 2'816 individuals, almost 25%. For Sicily/Lampedusa/Malta the difference is 1'391, for Calabria/Apulia 1'425. The gap is difficult to explain. It is unlikely that the media, on which I rely, have missed thousands of persons. Could it be that 'detections' are something else than 'arrivals'? - The numbers mentioned in FRONTEX's fourth quarter report (<a href="http://www.frontex.europa.eu/assets/Publications/Risk_Analysis/FRAN_Q4_2012.pdf">FRAN Q4 2012</a>) are higher as well, although the difference is only 10%. My count (for the Central Mediterranean in the narrower sense) is 3'000 'arrivals'; FRONTEX reports 3'476 'detections'.</p>

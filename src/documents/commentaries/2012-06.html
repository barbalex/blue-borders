	<h2>CHANGING DYNAMICS</h2>

	<p>During the first six months of 2011 about 35'000 migrants crossed the Central Mediterranean. <a href="index.php/events-2012/arrivals-2012">This year</a> the number is in the vicinity of 4'000 – or nine times less. It is an indication that the 2012 dynamics are different. There are fewer <strong>crossings</strong>, and patterns of <strong>arrival</strong> and of <strong>departure</strong> have changed. The number of <strong>accidents</strong> and <strong>victims</strong> has also diminished, and <strong>SAR</strong> and <strong>debarkation</strong> disputes are less frequent. The <strong>diplomatic</strong> and <strong>political</strong> fronts, too, are in motion. Unilateral, bilateral and multilateral efforts have been undertaken to find solutions for the more pressing problems. Some point in the right direction but many are incomplete, remain controversial or suffer from a lack of transparency. This is particularly true of agreements (or 'migration partnerships') tied to <strong>repatriation</strong>. Although the overall 'blue border' situation is less dramatic, much remains imperfect and has to be improved.</p>

	<h2>SHIFT IN ARRIVAL PATTERNS</h2>

	<p>Only 849 migrants have so far landed in <a href="index.php/events-2012/arrivals-2012">Lampedusa</a>, down from 32'000 a year ago. <a href="index.php/events-2012/arrivals-2012">Southern Italy</a> registered 2'252 arrivals (vs. 4'123 in 2011), <a href="index.php/events-2012/arrivals-2012">Malta</a> 972 (vs. 1'526). The numbers also show a <strong>shift in destinations</strong>. The main reason, of course, is that <strong>Lampedusa</strong> remains an 'unsafe port'. The <strong>diversion effect</strong> is obvious: In relative terms more boats are now headed for Malta, Sicily and Calabria. There is no clear indication whether or when Lampedusa will again become a 'safe port' to land. In Malta that creates a certain unease. In one week (from 27 May to 2 June) the island saw the arrival of 453 sub-Saharan Africans. The rush unleashed talk of a 'dramatic summer'. However, and as the government cautioned, such fears might prove unfounded (<a href="http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20120613/local/Too-early-to-sound-alarm-on-migration.424042">ToM 13.6.</a>).</p>

	<h2> CHANGE IN DEPARTURE PATTERNS</h2>

	<p>In the first six months of the previous year 15'000 migrants departed from <strong>Tunisia</strong>, 20'000 from <strong>Libya</strong>. That pattern, too, has changed. Since January of this year only 1'045 migrants have arrived from <a href="index.php/events-2012/arrivals-2012">Tunisia</a>. The reasons, it seems, are mainly political: With the end of turmoil and the functioning of the transitional government emigration has become less attractive and organized migrant smuggling more difficult. <a href="index.php/events-2012/arrivals-2012">Libya</a> is now the main country of embarkation with around 1700 departures. More precisely put, Libya continues to be a <strong>transit country</strong> for sub-Sahara migrants, mainly from East Africa (<a href="http://www.frontex.europa.eu/assets/Publications/Risk_Analysis/FRAN_Q1_2012.pdf">FRAN Q1 2012</a>). And, because Libyan politics are less settled, migrant smuggling continues to be a lucrative business, as interviews conducted in Malta indicate. Finally, there is an <strong>absolute increase</strong> in landings from <a href="index.php/events-2012/arrivals-2012">other locations</a>. In 2011, only 483 'Asians' arrived during the first six months, mostly from Greece and Turkey. That number has now jumped to 1335. As is to be expected, some refugees arrive from Syria, but there are also more Egyptians. Since April about 350 have landed, most of them in Southern Italy.</p>

	<h2>FEWER VICTIMS</h2>

	<p>The number of casualties is also down. 108 maritime migrants are reported missing or dead. That, again, is between nine and ten times less than last year (1'100). The victims, once more, are mostly <strong>sub-Saharan Africans</strong> departing from Libya. 55 died in mid-January off Misurata (<a href="http://fortresseurope.blogspot.ch/2012/01/libia-ritrovati-15-corpi-dopo-il.html">FE 28.1.</a>). On 19 June, seven 'North-Africans' were reported missing; whether they are <strong>Tunisians </strong>is uncertain. Also, Tunisian families demand information about 'harragas' <strong>missing </strong>since last year. As a sign of a more pluralistic polity, human rights organizations and the media are also getting involved (<a href="http://www.magharebia.com/cocoon/awi/xhtml1/en_GB/features/awi/features/2012/01/06/feature-01">Magh 6.1.</a>, <a href="http://www.tunisia-live.net/2012/03/30/one-year-on-tunisians-in-italy-are-still-missing/">TL 30.3.</a>, <a href="http://www.repubblica.it/solidarieta/immigrazione/2012/04/21/news/madre_di_migrante_tunisino_disperso_si_da_fuoco_per_protesta_contro_l_italia_una_delegazione_di_donne_rappresentanti_delle_f-33693577/index.html?ref=search">Rep 21.4.</a>, <a href="http://www.repubblica.it/solidarieta/immigrazione/2012/04/21/news/madre_di_migrante_tunisino_disperso_si_da_fuoco_per_protesta_contro_l_italia_una_delegazione_di_donne_rappresentanti_delle_f-33693577/index.html?ref=search"></a> <a href="http://www.thawrahtv.net/videos-streaming-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AF%D9%88%D8%B3%D9%8A-%D9%87%D8%A7%D8%AA-05-06-2012">Thawrah 5.6.</a>, <a href="http://www.tunisienumerique.com/tunisie-sit-in-des-familles-d%e2%80%99emigres-clandestins-devant-le-siege-de-lassemblee-nationale-constituante/128439">TN 6.6.</a>).The Tunisian authorities promise help, but the results are not encouraging.The main reason, so the Italian government, is the often poor quality of fingerprints needed for identification (<a href="http://www.ansamed.info/ansamed/en/news/sections/generalnews/2012/02/13/visualizza_new.html_97885998.html">ANSAmed 13.2.</a>, <a href="http://www.tunisia-live.net/2012/03/05/italy-to-use-tunisian-fingerprint-data-to-find-missing-immigrants/">TL 5.3</a>., <a href="http://www.repubblica.it/solidarieta/immigrazione/2012/04/21/news/madre_di_migrante_tunisino_disperso_si_da_fuoco_per_protesta_contro_l_italia_una_delegazione_di_donne_rappresentanti_delle_f-33693577/index.html?ref=search">Rep 21.4.</a>).</p>

	<h2>FEWER SAR &amp; DEBARKATION INCIDENTS</h2>

	<p>On 29 March, Tineke Strik published her report about the tragic SAR failure that occurred a year ago off Libya. The investigation, commissioned by the <strong>Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly</strong>, concludes that the main problem was a lack of coordination between Italy and NATO (<a href="http://assembly.coe.int/CommitteeDocs/2012/20120329_mig_RPT.EN.pdf">CoE 29.3.</a>, <a href="http://assembly.coe.int/ASP/NewsManager/EMB_NewsManagerView.asp?ID=7623">PACE 24.4.</a>). This year, fortunately, there was no comparable failure. In most cases SAR cooperation has functioned, also between <strong>Italy and Malta</strong> (<a href="http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20120531/local/migrants-boat+.422063">ToM 31.5.</a>). It even worked when merchant vessels were involved (<a href="http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20120115/local/68-migrants-being-brought-to-malta-after-rescue.402307">ToM 15.1.</a>, <a href="http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20120528/local/188-immigrants-land-in-12-hours.421592">ToM 28.5.</a>). Also, Italian and Maltese politicians have emphasized the need for improved SAR cooperation (<a href="http://www.maltatoday.com.mt/en/newsdetails/news/national/Napolitano-toasts-to-excellent-Malta-Italy-relations-calls-for-maturity-in-migration-issues-20120321">MT 21.3.</a>, <a href="http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20120623/local/Sending-migrants-back-is-not-wrong-.425553">ToM 23.6.</a>). Only one SAR dispute was reported (<a href="http://www.corriere.it/notizie-ultima-ora/Cronache_e_politica/Immigrazione-altri-barconi-arrivo/17-03-2012/1-A_001296860.shtml">CdS 17.3.</a>, <a href="http://www.maltatoday.com.mt/en/newsdetails/news/national/New-migrant-wave-from-Libya-puts-Armed-Forces-on-alert-20120317">MT 17.3.</a>). The main problem, as usual, is the unresolved debarkation issue. On 14 July 2010, the European Parliament took the matter to the <strong>European Court of Justice </strong>(<a href="http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&amp;docid=84101&amp;pageIndex=0&amp;doclang=en&amp;mode=req&amp;dir=&amp;occ=first&amp;part=1&amp;cid=347833">C-355/10</a>). If the Advocate General's opinion of late April is an indication, the rules might have to be changed (<a href="http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20120423/local/Unfair-EU-border-agency-rules-could-be-thrown-out.416469">ToM 23.4.</a>, <a href="http://migrantsatsea.wordpress.com/2012/04/25/eu-court-of-justice-advocate-general-recommends-annulment-of-frontex-sea-borders-rule/">MaS 25.4</a>.). It would be a minor but important step in the shaping of a more realistic EU migration policy.</p>

	<h2>THE END OF PUSH-BACK ?</h2>

	<p>On 23 January, the <strong>European Court of Human Rights</strong> decided that push-back, as practiced by the Berlusconi and Gaddafi governments, amounts to 'collective expulsion' and violates the European Human Rights Convention (<a href="http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx#{&quot;dmdocnumber&quot;:[&quot;901565&quot;],&quot;itemid&quot;:[&quot;001-109231&quot;]}">Hirsi v. Italy</a>). The Monti administration announced that the practice has been discontinued and that it respects the court's decision (<a href="http://www.ansa.it/web/notizie/collection/rubriche_politica/02/23/visualizza_new.html_103331798.html">ANSA 23.2.</a>, <a href="http://www.ansa.it/web/notizie/collection/rubriche_mondo/06/20/Terzi-faremo-respingimenti-immigrati-_7068080.html">ANSA 20.6.</a>). But, as various NGOs report, some forms of 'collective expulsion' are still going on (<a href="http://www.amnesty.it/giornata-mondiale-rifugiato-appello-a-italia-sulla-cooperazione-con-la-libia">AI 19.6.</a>, <a href="http://www.ansamed.info/ansamed/it/notizie/stati/italia/2012/06/20/Immigrazione-Unhcr-intesa-Italia-Libia-ignora-convenzioni_7068404.html">ANSAmed 20.6.</a>). 53 Egyptians, for instance, were 'summarily' returned by air on 29 June, only two days after their arrival at Catania (<a href="http://www.ansa.it/web/notizie/regioni/sicilia/2012/06/29/Immigrazione-rimpatriati-53-egiziani-sbarcati-Catania_7116038.html">ANSA 29.6.</a>).</p>

	<h2>NEW BILATERAL MIGRATION AGREEMENTS</h2>

	<p>The transitional governments of Tunisia and Libya have entered into a number of <strong>bilateral migration agreements</strong>. We know very little about their content (<a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/EUR01/013/2012/en/bc2ed705-d497-4a50-8c47-5995d3e2eb64/eur010132012en.pdf">AI 13.6.</a>). On 3 April <strong>Libya</strong> signed a migration accord with Italy the main emphasis of which seems to be on border control and repatriation (<a href="http://www.corriere.it/notizie-ultima-ora/Cronache_e_politica/Immigrazione-intesa-Cancellieri-Libia/03-04-2012/1-A_001363062.shtml">ANSA 3.4.</a>). Also in April, a joint <strong>Italian-Tunisian</strong> Military Committee discussed 'illegal migration as part of a comprehensive framework' (<a href="http://www.tap.info.tn/en/en/component/content/article/369-national-news-/13284--tunisian-italian-joint-military-committees-13th-session-closes.html">TAP 14.4.</a>). The agreement that followed refers to a 'strategic partnership covering economic and security issues' (<a href="http://www.tap.info.tn/en/en/component/content/article/45/14555.html">TAP 16.5.</a>). Terms like 'framework' and 'strategic partnership' suggest accords that are relatively broad and, presumably, cover matters like border management, the training of border personnel, the financing of operations – and <strong>repatriations</strong>. But the modalities governing repatriation, as many other details, remain in the dark. There are, so far, no reports about formal <strong>Maltese</strong> migration agreements with either Libya or Tunisia.</p>

	<h2>MIGRATION PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENTS</h2>

	<p>Cecilia Malmström, at the inauguration of the EUI's new Migration Policy Centre (MPC) in Florence, called for the conclusion of migration <strong>partnership</strong> agreements (<a href="http://www.eui.eu/News/2012/25-06-Malmstrom-MPC.aspx">EUI 25.6.</a>). She added that the Commission was in the process of negotiating such arrangements with Tunisia and Morocco (<a href="http://www.ansamed.info/ansamed/it/notizie/stati/europa/2012/05/15/Immigrazione-Ue-lavora-partnership-Tunisi-Rabat_6873802.html">ANSAmed 15.5.</a>). Partnerships, as the term implies, are two-way streets tackling migration in a comprehensive manner. Or, differently put, they deal with both irregular and regular migration and are therefore not limited to issues of security, control and repatriation. The regulation of <strong>economic migration</strong> is of particular importance. As the Commission's homepage shows the idea is to develop instruments encompassing professional training, academic studies and various types of short or long-term employment (<a href="http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/what-we-do/policies/immigration/index_en.htm">EUCOM Immigration</a>).</p>

	<h2>SWISS-TUNISIAN PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT</h2>

	<p>It is in this spirit that <strong>Switzerland</strong>, in June, signed a migration partnership with Tunisia (<a href="http://www.tap.info.tn/en/en/component/content/article/45/15556.html">TAP 11.6.</a>). Confronted with the presence of 3'000 Tunisians unlikely to get asylum, the Swiss decided to approach the government in Tunis and to suggest the conclusion of a migration partnership. It is a typical give-and-take combining a number of arrangements. The Tunisians are ready to accept returnees and to facilitate the re-entry of undocumented 'harragas' by issuing the necessary papers. In return the Swiss provide various types of assistance to voluntary returnees, issue 18 month visas for 150 professional trainees a year, are ready to train Tunisian border guards and promise a generous handling of visa applications in general. The agreement, compared with those signed by Italy, is relatively transparent.</p>

	<h2>MORE FRONTEX REPATRIATIONS</h2>

	<p>FRONTEX manages an increasing number of <strong>multilateral repatriations</strong> (<a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/EUR01/013/2012/en/bc2ed705-d497-4a50-8c47-5995d3e2eb64/eur010132012en.pdf">AI 13.6.</a>). The Warsaw organization, on its web-page, speaks about 'joint return operations' (<a href="http://www.frontex.europa.eu/operations/return">Operations</a>) but fails to list actual return flights (<a href="http://www.frontex.europa.eu/operations/archive-of-accomplished-operations">Returns</a>). 'Working arrangements' are the formal foundation for FRONTEX repatriations. Warsaw is in the process of negotiating such arrangements with various countries, amongst them Tunisia and Libya (<a href="http://www.frontex.europa.eu/partners/third-countries">Third Countries</a>). FRONTEX, as said, reveals no details about past and ongoing returns, but Malta does. In May, Malta repatriated 64 Nigerians on three flights organized and financed by FRONTEX (<a href="http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20120501/local/44-nigerians-repatriated.417876">ToM 1.5.</a>, <a href="http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20120510/local/nine-nigerian-migrants-repatriated.419231">ToM 10.5.</a>, <a href="http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20120524/local/11-nigerian-migrants-repatriated.421096">ToM 24.5.</a>). There was one flight to Ghana with 24 migrants (<a href="http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20120621/local/24-ghanaians-repatriated.425345">ToM 21.6.</a>).</p>

	<h2>INTERNAL VERSUS EXTERNAL BORDERS</h2>

	<p>When the <strong>EU JHA Council</strong> met in June, it dealt primarily with the reintroduction of temporary controls at Schengen's <strong>internal</strong> borders (<a href="http://www.repubblica.it/solidarieta/immigrazione/2012/06/07/news/shengen_sospeso_il_trattato_l_europa_si_difende_dai_migranti-36766753/index.html?ref=search">Rep 7.6.</a>). <strong>External</strong> borders and maritime migration were of marginal importance. The same priorities are reflected in the Commission's first <strong>Biannual Report on the Functioning of the Schengen Area </strong>(<a href="http://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/doc_centre/borders/docs/Biannual%20report%20on%20the%20functioning%20of%20the%20Schengen%20area%2020111101-20120430.pdf">EUCOM 16.5.</a>) covering the period from 1 November 2011 to 30 April 2012. The report's main focus is on organizational aspects and, once more, on the temporary reintroduction of internal controls. Remarks about Schengen's external borders are limited to three paragraphs. External borders may dominate the agenda when <strong>Cyprus</strong> assumes the presidency in July. The government announced that the completion of the Common European Asylum System was one of its top priorities (<a href="http://www.cyprus-mail.com/european/common-european-asylum-system-priority-presidency/20120626">Cyprus Mail 26.6.</a>, <a href="http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20120608/local/cypriot-eu-presidency-will-work-for-irregular-migration-problem-to-be-shared.423351">ToM 8.6.</a>).</p>

	<h2>MALTA RESETTLEMENTS</h2>

	<p>Malta's two resettlement schemes continue to function. With <strong>UNHCR support</strong> East African migrants who were granted asylum (Somalis, Eritreans and Sudanese) continue to be resettled in the <strong>United States</strong>. 27 of them departed in May and 19 in June, bringing this year's total to 213 (<a href="http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20120516/local/27-refugees-leave-for-the-us.419938">ToM 16.5.</a>, <a href="http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20120621/local/19-migrants-leave-for-the-us.425341">ToM 21.6.</a>). The second arrangement is the EU Commission's <strong>EUREMA</strong> project. Four relocations were reported: Two to Norway (<a href="http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20120131/local/eight-migrants-to-start-new-life-in-norway.404713">ToM 31.1.</a>, <a href="http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20120312/local/nine-migrants-move-to-norway.410841">ToM 12.3.</a>), and one each to Germany (<a href="http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20120213/local/migrants-move-to-germany.406583">ToM 13.2.</a>) and to the Netherlands (<a href="http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20120606/local/20-migrants-leave-for-the-netherlands.422955">ToM 6.6.</a>). Unfortunately, there is no truly reliable information on EUREMA. The data contained in the Commission's report on Migration, Asylum and Free Movement are helpful but not really detailed (<a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/12/552&amp;format=HTML&amp;aged=0&amp;language=EN&amp;guiLanguage=en">EUCOM</a>, <a href="http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20120605/local/Pledges-made-on-migrants-influx-are-just-token-says-an-EU-report.422803">ToM 5.6.</a>). </p>

	<h2>'PROTOCOL ON THE MEDITERRANEAN'</h2>

	<p>PACE rapporteur Tineke Strik, in her Strasbourg <a href="http://assembly.coe.int/ASP/NewsManager/EMB_NewsManagerView.asp?ID=7733">address</a> of 31 May, urged the EU to strengthen existing international rules of the sea. More precisely, EU members should draft what she calls a 'Protocol on the Mediterranean' covering such issues as <strong>rescue</strong>, <strong>repatriation</strong> and <strong>resettlement</strong> of migrants and refugees. Chris Said, the new Maltese Minister of Justice, also called for new legal steps. At the JHA Council meeting in June, he urged the EU to decide on a common resettlement policy and, tied to it, on a redefinition of the Dublin 'first country' rule (<a href="http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20120607/local/migration-malta-calls-for-solidarity-review-of-dublin-treaty.423240">ToM 7.6.</a>).</p>

	<h2>MIGRANT SMUGGLING</h2>

	<p>Many migrants travel on rubber dinghies driven by outboard motors, make use of satellite phones and navigating instruments, need gasoline, food and water supplies. <strong>Migrant smugglers</strong> (or 'facilitators') are in the business of providing these necessities and, as interviews show, charge at least € 1000 per person. At times they serve as 'captains', try to land at night and to evade capture. Accounts about arrests come primarily from <strong>Italy</strong>. More than a dozen cases were reported from January thru July. There are no similar reports from <strong>Malta</strong> although it is fair to assume that some migrants depart for Italy with the help of smugglers (<a href="http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20120429/local/Sicily-link-in-mystery-of-caught-migrants.417434">ToM 29.4.</a>). There is practically no information about court cases and sentencing. We read, however, that a <strong>Tunisian court</strong> started proceedings against a local migrant smuggler for organizing, in March a year ago, a trip from Sfax to Italy with 15 'harragas' missing (<a href="http://ffm-online.org/2012/05/28/tunesien-kriminalisierung-der-ausreise/">FFM 28.5.</a>).</p>

	<h2>FEWER DATA GAPS</h2>

	<p>Compared to 2011, data gaps are narrowing. The number of <strong>victims</strong> recorded by <em>Fortress Europe </em>and by myself is virtually identical; we both count around 110 dead and missing (<a href="http://fortresseurope.blogspot.ch/p/la-strage-negata-17317-morti-ai-confini.html">FE</a>). Most <strong>arrival</strong> figures are close as well. On 7 June, the <strong>Malta</strong> government speaks of 832 landings; my figure is 827 (<a href="http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20120607/local/migration-malta-calls-for-solidarity-review-of-dublin-treaty.423240">ToM 7.6.</a>). <strong>Italian</strong> numbers, as reported by Anna Maria Cancellieri at the end of March, are also fairly congruent (<a href="http://www.corriere.it/notizie-ultima-ora/Cronache_e_politica/Immigrazione-407-sbarcati-2012/28-03-2012/1-A_001333885.shtml">CdS 28.3.</a>). For <strong>Lampedusa</strong> her count is 573, mine 511. On<strong> all Italian coasts</strong>, so Ms Cancellieri, 1'407 migrants arrived. That leaves us with 834 arrivals once the Lampedusa figure is deducted; my count for Southern Italy is 765. It is possible, of course, that around 70 migrants landed on beaches not covered by this website. Data quality is obviously improving - with one noteable exception. For the 1st quarter of this year <strong>FRONTEX</strong> mentions over 1500 Central Mediterranean 'detections' (<a href="http://www.frontex.europa.eu/assets/Publications/Risk_Analysis/FRAN_Q1_2012.pdf">FRAN Q1 2012</a>). My count is a mere 833! Also, questionable 2011 figures continue to make the round. Christofer Hein, director of the <strong>Italian Refugee Council</strong> (CIR), maintains that 2'200 migrants drowned in the 'Strait of Sicily' (<a href="http://www.ansamed.info/ansamed/en/news/nations/oman/2012/01/18/visualizza_new.html_46193655.html">ANSAmed 18.1.</a>). The UNHCR figure is 1'500, my count is below that. Also, most of the major accidents occurred not 'in' but 'outside' the Strait of Sicily. <strong>FRONTEX</strong>, in its 2012 Annual Risk Analysis published on 20 April, contends that last year there were 64'000 'detections' in the Central Mediterranean, a claim that is imprecise, to say the least (<a href="http://migrantsatsea.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/frontex_annual_risk_analysis_2012.pdf">ARA 20.4.</a>).</p>

	<h2>MINIMAL FRONTEX INFORMATION</h2>

	<p>Some FRONTEX information is incomplete. On its website the organization mentions operations <strong>accomplished</strong> - but remains silent about those <strong>going on </strong>(<a href="http://www.frontex.europa.eu/operations/archive-of-accomplished-operations">FRONTEX</a>). As shown, the pattern is the same for repatriations; the information we have about ongoing returns is indirect and from the press. It also applies to Joint Operations <strong>HERMES</strong> and <strong>AENEAS</strong>. The host country for both is Italy but they cover different parts of the Central Mediterranean. JO HERMES concentrates on the area south of Sicily; the focus of JO AENEAS is more to the East, on Apulia and Calabria - and on crossings from Greece, Turkey and Egypt. This year, if we are to believe Italian media reports, FRONTEX seems to specialize in aerial surveillance (<a href="http://ansamed.ansa.it/ansamed/it/notizie/rubriche/cronaca/2012/07/16/Immigrazione-Bari-127-migranti-soccorsi-GDF-7-ricoveri_7191516.html">ANSAmed</a>, <a href="http://bari.ilquotidianoitaliano.it/cronaca/2012/07/news/bari-sbarcati-al-porto-127-immigrati-in-viaggio-da-giorni-7-ricoveri-13589.html/">QI</a>, <a href="https://watchthemed.crowdmap.com/reports/view/28">WTM</a>). Fortunately, other FRONTEX publications are somewhat more informative, at least on certain subjects. Examples are the regularly appearing Quarterly Reports (<a href="http://www.frontex.europa.eu/assets/Publications/Risk_Analysis/FRAN_Q4_2011.pdf">FRAN Q4 2011</a>, <a href="http://www.frontex.europa.eu/assets/Publications/Risk_Analysis/FRAN_Q1_2012.pdf">FRAN Q1 2012</a>) and the <a href="http://migrantsatsea.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/frontex_annual_risk_analysis_2012.pdf">2012 Annual Risk Analysis</a> (ARA).</p>

	<h2>UNEVEN SAR INFORMATION</h2>

	<p>The most detailed SAR information comes from <strong>Malta</strong>. The local press, at times, publishes fairly exhaustive accounts of certain incidents. And, on their new website, the Armed Forces themselves inform about their operations (<a href="http://www.afm.gov.mt/newsarchive?l=1&amp;cid=82">AFM</a>). Not so in <strong>Italy</strong>. There is, to my knowledge, no regular SAR information emanating from official quarters. The news available stems mainly from the press. It is harder yet to obtain reliable SAR information from the other side of the Mediterranean. Only two incidents are reported from <strong>Tunisia</strong>. In January, the TCG stopped 43 migrants (<a href="http://www.tap.info.tn/en/en/regions/9194-illegal-emigration-attempt-thwarted-43-persons-rescued-at-el-bkalta.html">TAP 12.1.</a>) and in March, in the context of the Italian-Maltese disembarkation dispute, 74 migrants were taken ashore (<a href="http://www.maltatoday.com.mt/en/newsdetails/news/national/AFM-hit-back-at-Italian-media-over-migrants-rescue-20120318">MT 19.3.</a>). The press release of 12 January mentions (in passing) that last year Tunisia 'thwarted' 24 illegal emigration attempts and 'rescued' 647 people. No further details are given. Tunisian reports seem to emanate from the government, but information about <strong>Libyan</strong> SAR incidents come mostly from the European press. These reports, too, are limited to two accidents. The first refers to the January tragedy with 55 victims (<a href="http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20120129/local/15-dead-40-missing-as-migrants-boat-capsizes-off-libya.404242">ToM 29.1.</a>), the second to a May incident with 10 migrants missing (<a href="http://www.ansa.it/web/notizie/regioni/sicilia/2012/05/26/Immigrazione-4-imbarcazioni-soccorse-ieri-canale-Sicilia_6934991.html">ANSA 26.5.</a>). It is to be hoped that the two governments, as part of their reorganization, will adopt a more open information policy.</p>

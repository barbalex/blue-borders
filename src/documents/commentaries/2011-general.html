	<p>The comments below refer to the year 2011, rest on information contained in the chronology and are extremely succinct.</p>

	<h2>LAMPEDUSA</h2>

	<p>85% of all Central Mediterranean migrants – or 38'000 of roughly 45'000 – end up in Lampedusa. The remaining southern coasts of Italy account for 11%, Malta for around 4%. Lampedusa is clearly the most important destination. For an attempt to explain this one-sided distribution, see the special pages on <a href="index.php/problems-a-solutions/problems-2011">Problems</a> and <a href="index.php/responses">Solutions</a>. On 23 September, the Italian government declared Lampedusa an "unsafe port" for landing.</p>

	<h2>ARRIVAL PATTERNS</h2>

	<p>For the year 2011, it is useful to distinguish three Lampedusa arrival patterns: (1) "isolated" arrivals of up to 300 persons during one or two days;  (2) arrival "waves", ranging from 300 to 5'000 persons and lasting up to ten days; (3) arrival "cycles", covering several months.</p>

	<p><strong>"Isolated"</strong> Lampedusa arrivals are relatively rare. There are only a handful of examples: 76 Tunisians (3-4 Sept.), 121 Tunisians (30 Aug.), 200 Tunisians (19-21 Aug.), 231 Sub-Saharan Africans (17 July), 286 Sub-Saharan Africans (13 July). Most other arrivals, especially from February to June, were part of longer and more massive flows.</p>

	<p>There were 24 <strong>"waves"</strong>,15 of which included over 1'000 migrants. The largest rush lasted 11 days (18-28 March) and totaled 5'100 Tunisians, 2'000 of whom arrived in a single 24-hour period (27-28 March).</p>

	<p><strong>"Cycles"</strong> last for several months. There was a two-month <a href="index.php/events-2011/arrivals-totals">Tunisian cycle</a><strong> </strong>stretching from early February to the beginning of April. It was followed by a five-month <a href="index.php/events-2011/arrivals-totals">Libyan cycle</a><strong> </strong>(mainly Sub-Saharan Africans) that lasted from the middle of March through the middle of August. The two cycles coincide with domestic upheaval in Tunisia and Libya. A third and smaller cycle began mid-August and ended toward the end of September.</p>

	<h2>PORTS OF DEPARTURE</h2>

	<p>Publicly available sources do not name specific ports of departure. No pattern can be established. However, it is safe to assume that when Italian and Maltese authorities interview migrants, they are able to establish ports (and possibly circumstances) of departure. At least that is what FRONTEX reports seem to suggest.</p>

	<h2>NATIONALITIES</h2>

	<p>The chronology distinguishes between "Tunisians", "Sub-Saharan Africans" and "Others". For Lampedusa and the southern Italian ports the <strong>largest group </strong>consists of Sub-Saharan migrants (25'000) from West, East and Central Africa. It appears that many were laborers expelled by the Gaddafi regime. The <strong>second largest group </strong>is Tunisians (17'800). By far the <strong>smallest group </strong>is "Others" (2'700). When identified as "Asians" this group can include migrants from Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and other places to the "East". Given the fact that most migrants are undocumented (or "sans-papiers" and "irregulars"), determination of their nationality is often problematic.</p>

	<h2>ITALIAN/MALTESE COMPARISON</h2>

	<p>The population of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy">Italy</a> is 150 times larger than that of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malta">Malta</a> (60 million vs. 400'000). If debarkations were proportional, the 1'500 arrivals for Malta would amount to 225'000 for Italy. The actual figure is around 45'000, five times less! Small wonder that the Maltese feel Italy should do more and, to alleviate their burden, demand the establishment of an EU refugee reloaction scheme. For a detailed discussion of the various Italian-Maltese debarkation incidents and of possible remedies see <a href="index.php/problems-a-solutions/problems-2011">Problems</a> and <a href="index.php/responses">Solutions</a>.</p>

	<h2>REPATRIATION</h2>

	<p>Under the agreement of 6 April with Tunisia, the Italian government repatriated the first migrants on 14 April. After the September closing of Lampedusa almost 1500 Tunisians were flown back (23.9.-7.10.). In Italy repatriation figures are (at times) publicized, in Tunisia they are not. More recently Italy has begun to repatriate Egyptians (25.10., 20.11.). Repatriation presupposes disembarkation, whereas "push backs", as practiced between Italy and Libya in 2009 and 2010, imply a direct return without disembarkation. 42 Afghans were "pushed back" to Greece (15.11.); 100 Tunisians were "pushed back" to the Tunisian Coast Guard (22.8.).</p>

	<h2>MIGRANT PROTESTS</h2>

	<p>There were half a dozen protests at Italian reception camps, and there was one at Malta. Some involved only a handful of people and were peaceful, but others were massive, as was the case when Tunisians practically burnt down the Lampedusa facilities in September. Tunisians tended to protest against repatriation (22-23 Sept., 29-30 Aug., 18 Aug.), whereas others complained about detention conditions or the slow process of status determination (16-17 Aug.).</p>

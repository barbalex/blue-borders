	<h2>SUMMARY STATEMENT</h2>

	<p>The first six months of this year, compared to the same period of last year, saw a number of significant changes: <strong>Total arrivals</strong> increased by 50%; <strong>Tunisian</strong> departures almost stopped; the number of migrants leaving from <strong>Libya</strong> practically doubled, and there was a 50% increase in arrivals from the <strong>'East'</strong>, amongst them a growing number of Egyptians and Syrians. There was also a shift in arrival <strong>destination</strong>s: For Malta the figures are down, for Southern Italy they are up. Lampedusa saw several 'waves' – the largest around the middle of June. The <strong>political scene</strong> changed, too. Malta, Italy and Tunisia have new governments, and in Libya the GNC president was replaced. Libyan transition remains fragile – and insecure – making the country a (risky) transit route for sub-Saharan Africans. To limit the flow, both national and international efforts are being undertaken. As usual, the <strong>European Union</strong> is concentrating on <strong>border surveillance</strong> and on strengthening its <strong>asylum policy</strong>.</p>

	<h2>ARRIVALS &amp; DESTINATIONS</h2>

	<p>There were (by my count) 6'765 <strong>arrivals</strong> during the first half of 2013 compared to 4'073 during same period of 2012. <strong>Lampedusa</strong> saw 2'967 landings (vs. 849), <strong>Southern Italy</strong> 3'488 (vs. 2'252). Only <strong>Malta</strong> witnessed a decrease: 310 compared to 972. As usual, and as Graph 2 shows, most arrivals were during the second quarter. For Lampedusa and Southern Italy the inflow was extremely uneven. Lampedusa saw five major 'waves': a first one in late March, two in April and a fourth in the first part of May. There was then a six-week pause, followed by a fifth surge of nearly 900 migrants between 15 and 20 June. Meteorological conditions explain part of the pattern, but it seems that organized smuggling played a role as well.</p>

	<h2>DEPARTURE AREAS</h2>

	<p><strong>Tunisian</strong> departures, as Graph 3 shows, almost stopped. It is possible that some sub-Saharan Africans (originally from Libya) left from Tunisia, but only 73 Tunisian nationals were counted. The number was 1'054 for the same period of last year, and 15'000 in 2011. The <strong>decrease</strong> contrasts with an <strong>increase</strong> in the two other areas of departure. The number of migrants leaving from <strong>Libya</strong> jumped from 1'693 last year to 4'359 this year. Most of them, as mentioned, are sub-Saharan Africans heading for Lampedusa and Malta. Arrivals from the <strong>'East'</strong> are also up: from 1'335 last year to 2'333 this year. As usual, these migrants landed in Calabria and Apulia, although some made it to the Eastern coast of Sicily. Most are referred to as 'Asians' and include Afghans, Pakistanis and Iraqis, but there is also an increasing number of Syrians and Egyptians.</p>

	<h2>VICTIMS</h2>

	<p>Although arrivals are up by over 50%, the number of victims <strong>decreased</strong>. My count is 78 casualties during the first semester, compared to 108 for the same period of 2012. Of the 78 victims, 26 were found dead, and 52 are reported missing. There were <strong>four major accidents</strong>, two off the Libyan coast and two near Italy. The largest accident with 41 victims occurred on 19 March west of Tripoli (<a href="http://www.libyaherald.com/2013/03/19/nine-unidentified-bodies-found-on-shore-near-sabratha/">LH 19.3.</a>); another accident with 20 victims occurred on 16 April near the coast of Apulia (<a href="http://www.ansa.it/web/notizie/regioni/puglia/2013/04/16/39-immigrati-bloccati-Leuca-ricerche_8560791.html">ANSA 16.4.</a>). Seven casualties were reported on 16 June off Lampedusa (<a href="http://www.ansa.it/web/notizie/regioni/sicilia/2013/06/16/Immigrazione-profughi-soccorsi-7-morti_8880127.html">ANSA 16.6.</a>), and there were 5 more victims on 13 April, again west of Tripoli (<a href="http://www.libyaherald.com/2013/04/13/five-migrants-die-at-sea-89-rescued/">LH 13.4.</a>). Most of the casualties were <strong>sub-Sahara Africans</strong> starting from Libya. The route from Libya, as always, turns out to be the most hazardous. The 20 Apulia victims were 'Asians'; there were no reports of Tunisian victims.</p>

	<h2>SUCCESSFUL SAR OPERATIONS</h2>

	<p>Not all <strong>SAR operations</strong> are successful, but, as last year, the large majority are. All told, 34 operations were communicated, 4 during the first quarter, 30 during the second. Most of them were carried out by the Italian Guardia Costiera, a well-equipped force specialized in handling various types of maritime rescues. In many cases the force was assisted by the Guardia di Finanza and by ships of the Italian Navy. On four occasions commercial vessels were also involved (<a href="http://www.ansa.it/web/notizie/regioni/sicilia/2013/04/10/Immigrazione-due-barconi-Sud-Lampedusa_8528529.html">ANSA 10.4.</a>, <a href="http://palermo.repubblica.it/cronaca/2013/04/20/news/lampedusa_sbarchi_senza_sosta_soccorso_gommone_con_84_migranti-57060741/?ref=search">Rep 22.4.</a>, <a href="http://palermo.repubblica.it/cronaca/2013/06/15/news/raffica_di_sbarchi_in_sicilia_soccorsi_300_migranti-61142613/">Rep 15.6.</a>, <a href="http://www.ansa.it/web/notizie/regioni/sicilia/2013/06/19/Immigrazione-97-migranti-Lampedusa_8893023.html">ANSA 19.6.</a>). Some Italian SAR operations were close to the Libyan coast. This is an indication that, if necessary, Italy operates far outside its own zone of responsibility.</p>

	<h2>SAR COOPERATION</h2>

	<p>SAR <strong>cooperation, </strong>too, seems to function in many instances. That is not self-evident given Malta's over-sized SAR Coordination area and the still unresolved issue of disembarkation<strong>. </strong>But, once again, there were no reports of <strong>Maltese-Italian disputes</strong>. On the contrary, there were several accounts of successful cooperation (<a href="http://www.ansa.it/web/notizie/regioni/sicilia/2013/06/08/Immigrazione-250-sbarcati-Siracusano_8839660.html">ANSA 8.6.</a>, <a href="http://www.ansa.it/web/notizie/regioni/sicilia/2013/05/11/Immigrazione-139-soccorsi-Lampedusa_8689070.html">ANSA 11.5.</a>) In one case Italian units also cooperated with the <strong>Tunisian</strong> Coast Guard (<a href="http://palermo.repubblica.it/cronaca/2013/06/08/news/capo_passero_e_lampedusa_in_275_sbarcano_dal_nordafrica-60687336/">Rep 9.6.</a>) and in another case with both Maltese and <strong>Libyan</strong> units (<a href="http://www.ansa.it/web/notizie/regioni/sicilia/2013/05/11/Immigrazione-139-soccorsi-Lampedusa_8689070.html">ANSA 11.5.</a>).</p>

	<h2>'CANALE 13'</h2>

	<p>A multi-national SAR exercise called 'Canale 13' was conducted in June (<a href="http://www.afm.gov.mt/NewsDetails?l=1&amp;nid=2168&amp;cid=83">AFM 19.6.</a>). It was organized by North African and Southern European states participating in the '5+5 Dialogue' – Libya, Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco and Mauritania on the one hand, and Portugal, Spain, France, Italy and Malta on the other. At the '5+5' summit in Malta on 6 October 2012 the participants decided to set up a Search and Rescue task force. 'Canale 13' seems to have resulted from that decision. No details about the nature of the exercise were communicated, and there is also no information about a possible repetition.</p>

	<h2>TUNISIA</h2>

	<p>Provisional Tunisian PM Hamadi Jebali resigned on 19 February. Ali Larayedh was appointed Prime Minister in early March (<a href="http://www.tap.info.tn/en/index.php/politics2/5869-jebali-announces-resignation">TAP 19.2.</a>, <a href="http://www.tap.info.tn/en/index.php/politics2/6310-larayedh-announces-government-line-up">TAP 8.3.</a>). On 15 June, the new Tunisian draft constitution was submitted after 18 months of deliberations (<a href="http://www.tap.info.tn/en/index.php/politics2/9239-draft-constitution-formally-submitted-after-one-year-and-a-half-of-debate">TAP 15.6.</a>). Elections for a new parliament are expected to take place in the fall. The transition process is being accompanied by regular contacts with the <strong>European Union</strong>. In January, Herman van Rompuy visited Tunisia (<a href="http://www.tap.info.tn/en/index.php/politics2/4716-the-eu-is-a-friend-and-a-privileged-partner-of-new-tunisia-says-van-rompuy">TAP 16.1.</a>), and in June PM Ali Larayedh met J.M. Barroso in Brussels (<a href="http://www.tap.info.tn/en/index.php/politics2/9559-privileged-partnership-at-centre-of-larayedh-barroso-talk">TAP 25.6.</a>). The purpose of both meetings was to clarify the 'privileged partnership' signed on 19 November 2012. However, it is not clear what the agreement exactly stands for, especially with regard to maritime migration.</p>

	<h2>TUNISIAN SAR INFORMATION</h2>

	<p>Information about Tunisian <strong>SAR operations</strong> is rare. According to an unconfirmed NGO statement, 65 sub-Saharan Africans were <strong>rescued</strong> in March off Médenine on the way from Libya to Italy. Given its source, the account is anything but comprehensive (<a href="http://www.shemsfm.net/fr/actualite/65-immigres-clandestins-de-differentes-nationalites-sauves-au-large-de-medenine?id=41233">FFM 28.3.</a>). To beef up Tunisian <strong>SAR capabilities</strong> Italy supplied the country with new patrol boats. In January, two off-shore patrol boats were delivered (<a href="http://ffm-online.org/2013/01/12/italienische-patrouillenschiffen-an-tunesien/">FFM 12.1.</a>), followed in April by two more boats and 60 land vehicles (<a href="http://www.tap.info.tn/en/index.php/politics2/7625-italy-wants-to-be-tunisia-s-ambassador-within-the-european-community-anna-maria-cancellieri">TAP 24.4.</a>). We do not know whether the hardware went to the Tunisian Navy or the National Guard. There is also no indication concerning the context of these Italian deliveries.</p>

	<h2>TUNISIAN DEPARTURE PREVENTIONS</h2>

	<p>Three reports deal with Tunisian <strong>departure preventions</strong>. A first official communication, in early January, referred to a case near Monastir, but no details were given (<a href="http://www.tap.info.tn/en/index.php/regions/4383-illegal-immigration-attempt-thwarted-by-teboulba-sea-patrol">TAP 8.1.</a>). A second account, coming from NGOs, mentioned 20 (possibly 22) migrants intercepted by the National Guard, again near Monastir (<a href="http://ffm-online.org/2013/02/17/tunesien-20-boat-people-in-kustennahe-gestoppt/">FFM 17.2.</a>). A third (official) report referred to 26 nationals stopped by the Coast Guard off Kelibia (near Tunis) (<a href="http://www.tap.info.tn/en/index.php/society/7402-illegal-immigration-attempt-thwarted-26-people-arrested">TAP 17.4.</a>). There was also an official news release referring to six Tunisians arrested for <strong>organized illegal migration</strong> (<a href="http://www.tap.info.tn/en/index.php/regions/4248-illegal-immigration-attempt-six-people-arrested-in-monastir">TAP 3.1.</a>).</p>

	<h2>MISSING 'HARRAGAS'</h2>
	<p>The fate of missing 'harragas' continues to occupy families and NGOs. There is still no <strong>official statement</strong> about the joint Italian-Tunisian investigation started last year after the 6 September Lampedusa accident with 79 victims. The lack of news explains why the mothers of missing 'harragas' sent a video letter to the mayor of Lampedusa, Giusti Nicolini, demanding an investigation by the European Parliament (<a href="http://www.storiemigranti.org/spip.php?article1053">StM 2.7.</a>). The request was accompanied by a list describing eight unresolved cases and was published by <em>Storie migranti</em> (<a href="http://www.storiemigranti.org/spip.php?article1054">StM 20.7.</a>)</p>

	<h2>CONTESTED FIGURES</h2>

	<p>Figures about missing 'harragas' remain contested. At the end of March, the Fondation Tunisienne pour les Droits Economiques et Sociaux (FTDES) issued a report dealing with the year 2012 (<a href="http://nawaat.org/portail/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/rapport_immigrant-2013_2.pdf">link</a>). 350 Tunisians 'disappeared', so the conclusion, and 'several dozen' died, amounting to a total of around 400 casualties. My count is much lower: Of a total of 309 victims for the entire Central Mediterranean at most 100 are Tunisians, 79 of whom were those lost in the 7 September accident off Lampedusa. FTDES figures for 2011 are also much higher; the NGO mentions 1'000 Tunisian victims; my count is 350. Lower figures are also used in the video message sent by the mothers of missing 'harragas' to Lampedusa Mayor Giusi Nicolini. They mention that between 250 and 400 families were affected in two years.</p>

	<h2>LIBYA</h2>

	<p>Libya is also in a state of <strong>political transition,</strong> but the situation is more fluid and fragile than in Tunisia. Cabinet members come and go, among them the ministers of defense, the interior and foreign affairs. Mohammed el-Megarif, GNC chairman and provisional president, left office in June in response to a decree ('Isolation Law') prohibiting high-ranking Gaddafi officials to be politically active (<a href="http://www.libyaherald.com/2013/05/28/magarief-resigns-as-gnc-head-in-anticipation-of-being-forced-out-by-isolation-law-2/">LH 28.5</a>.). <strong>Violent unrest</strong> is endemic and <strong>assassinations</strong> are common. The government lacks control over many areas, including land and maritime borders. Small wonder that Libya is a transit route for sub-Saharan Africans and that organized migrant smuggling cannot be stopped. Reports about <strong>SAR incidents </strong>are still scarce, but some do find their way into the local press (<a href="http://www.libyaherald.com/2013/03/19/nine-unidentified-bodies-found-on-shore-near-sabratha/">LH 19.4.</a>, <a href="http://www.libyaherald.com/2013/04/13/five-migrants-die-at-sea-89-rescued/">LH 13.4.</a>, <a href="http://www.libyaherald.com/2013/05/14/coastguard-retrieves-empty-migrant-boat-suspects-tragic-end/">LH 14.5.</a>).</p>

	<h2>LIBYAN SECURITY</h2>

	<p>Libyan <strong>insecurity</strong> creates uneasiness and is the subject of diplomatic discussions. Early in the year, Libyan PM el-Megarif met his counterparts from <strong>Algeria</strong> and <strong>Tunisia</strong> in Ghadames (Libya) to deal with border security (<a href="http://www.tripolipost.com/articledetail.asp?c=1&amp;i=9737">TA 11.1.</a>). El-Megarif also went to Rome, and as part of the visit, the defense ministers of Libya and Italy conferred (<a href="http://www.ansamed.info/ansamed/it/notizie/rubriche/politica/2013/01/10/Italia-Libia-Mgarief-roma-partnership-prioritaria_8053399.html">ANSAmed 10.1.</a>). In February, the Libyan and <strong>Maltese</strong> Foreign Ministers met in Tripoli ahead of a special <strong>Paris Summit</strong> on Libyan security (<a href="http://www.libyaherald.com/2013/02/10/libya-and-malta-confer-ahead-of-paris-summit/">LH 10.2.</a>). And the new Maltese PM, Joseph Muscat, visited Tripoli twice, also to discuss security (<a href="http://www.libyaherald.com/2013/04/29/maltas-new-prime-minister-wants-a-different-stronger-link-with-libya/">LH 29.4.</a>, <a href="http://www.maltatoday.com.mt/en/newsdetails/news/national/Illegal-immigration-purchase-of-petrol-dominates-Libya-talks-20130623">MT 23.6.</a>).</p>

	<h2>'FRENCH CONNECTION'</h2>

	<p>The French, given their involvement in Mali, seem to take a particular interest in <strong>Libyan security</strong>. It was the French government that organized a Libyan <strong>security conference</strong> in Paris attended by eleven nations, including a number of IOs (<a href="http://www.libyaherald.com/2013/02/12/conference-in-paris-calls-for-action-on-security/">LH 12.2.</a>). No specifics were published, but it was apparent that, among other things, France was ready to beef up the Libyan Coast Guard. Thirty patrol boats were delivered in May, with 25 South Korean vessels to follow (<a href="http://www.libyaherald.com/2013/05/21/navy-takes-delivery-of-new-french-fast-patrol-boats/">LH 20.5.</a>). An additional French boat arrived in June (<a href="http://www.libyaherald.com/2013/06/23/new-military-speedboat-boosts-benghazi-naval-force/">LH 23.6.</a>). Also in June there was a Libyan-French <strong>naval exercise</strong> (<a href="http://www.libyaherald.com/2013/06/27/libyan-french-naval-exercise-nears-end/">LH 27.6.</a>), and, as mentioned, France and Libya were both involved in 'Canale 13'. It was also in the French (and Italian) interest, one would assume, to put Libya on the <strong>G8 Agenda</strong> (<a href="http://www.libyaherald.com/2013/06/18/g8-leaders-affirm-support-for-libya/">LH 18.6.</a>), to invite PM Zeidan to <strong>NATO</strong> headquarters (<a href="http://www.presstv.ir/detail/2013/05/28/305865/nato-to-give-technical-support-to-libya/">PTV 27.5.</a>) and to persuade Libya to seek <strong>OSCE</strong> membership (<a href="http://www.libyaherald.com/2013/06/29/libya-wants-to-join-european-security-body/">LH 29.6.</a>).</p>

	<h2>ITALY &amp; LAMPEDUSA</h2>

	<p>In April, <strong>Enrico Letta</strong> followed Mario Monti as Italian prime minister. <strong>Anna Maria Cancellieri</strong> left the Interior Ministry and is now in charge of Justice. The impact of these changes on the situation at <strong>Lampedusa</strong> continued to be positive. There is no repetition of the deplorable situation 'produced' by the Berlusconi government in 2011. There is also a new minister for integration, <strong>Cecile Kyenge</strong>, an immigrant from Congo (Zaire). She visited Lampedusa after the massive June influx and, together with Mayor <strong>Giusi Nicolini</strong>, managed to introduce some changes (<a href="http://www.ansa.it/web/notizie/regioni/sicilia/2013/06/25/Immigrazione-Kyenge-andro-Lampedusa_8924341.html">ANSA 25.6.</a>). The reception center is now more regularly cleared by transferring migrants by ferry (or by air). However, it remains uncertain whether 'collective returns' are still taking place – not of East Africans likely to obtain asylum but, as the UNHCR fears, with respect to Egyptians (<a href="http://www.unhcr.it/news/dir/26/view/1481/le-organizzazioni-umanitarie-chiedono-di-incontrare-i-migranti-egiziani-e-tunisini-che-sbarcano-sulle-coste-italiane-148100.html">HCR 30.4.</a>).</p>

	<h2>MALTA</h2>

	<p>Malta has a new government, too. The <strong>Socialist Party</strong> won the March elections and replaced the Nationalists who, with a minor interruption, had ruled for 26 years (<a href="http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20130313/local/cabinet.461208">ToM 13.3.</a>). With regard to migration the new prime minister, <strong>Joseph Muscat</strong>, is pursuing a more <strong>aggressive line</strong>. He complains about EU inaction and mentions 'push-back' as an alternative (<a href="http://www.maltatoday.com.mt/en/newsdetails/news/national/On-emotive-migration-Muscat-still-supports-pushbacks-to-safe-ports-20130626">MT 26.6.</a>, <a href="http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20130523/local/Brussels-ditches-proposal-to-aid-Malta-relocate-migrants.470847">ToM 23.5.</a>). The unresolved issues, we know, are <strong>disembarkation</strong> and <strong>relocation</strong>. On these points Malta expects more EU solidarity. The demand is not unreasonable. Over 90% of the arriving migrants obtain refugee or humanitarian status, by far the highest rate in the EU, as EUROSTAT and EASO figures show (<a href="http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20130618/local/more-than-90-per-cent-of-immigrants-in-malta-get-refugee-humanitarian-status.474370">ToM 18.6.</a>, <a href="http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_PUBLIC/3-18062013-AP/EN/3-18062013-AP-EN.PDF">Eurostat</a>, <a href="http://easo.europa.eu/wp-content/uploads/EUREMA-fact-finding-report-EASO1.pdf">EASO</a>). The reason, of course, is that most arrivals are from East Africa. It is true that the two relocation programs, <strong>EUREMA</strong> and <strong>USRAP</strong>, continue to function (<a href="http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20130117/local/26-immigrants-leave-malta-to-start-new-life-in-us-poland.453664">ToM 17.1.</a>, <a href="http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20130402/local/18-refugees-leave-for-the-us.463913">ToM 2.4.</a>) and that there are also voluntary returns (<a href="http://www.maltatoday.com.mt/en/newsdetails/news/national/73-immigrants-volunteer-to-return-to-country-of-origin-20130625">MT 25.6.</a>). But in Maltese eyes that is not enough.</p>

	<h2>EU &amp; ASYLUM</h2>

	<p>The EU, once more, is concentrating on <strong>asylum policy</strong> and <strong>border surveillance</strong>. In both areas Parliament now has the last say. The tripartite process is slow, but the quality of regulations and directives tends to improve. Efforts to strengthen the <strong>Common European Asylum System</strong> are a case in point. On 11 and 12 June the EUPL approved of changes affecting the Reception Conditions Directive, the Asylum Procedures Directive and the Dublin Regulation (<a href="http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/en/jha/137420.pdf">EUCL 7.6.</a>). The goal is to <strong>harmonize standards</strong> and to improve <strong>migrant protection</strong> and <strong>administrative efficiency</strong>. On 17 June the EU Commission published its <strong>4<sup>th</sup> Annual Report</strong> on Immigration and Asylum. Besides giving a useful overview it mentions some of the issues that remain to be solved (<a href="http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/e-library/documents/policies/immigration/general/docs/4th_annual_report_on_immigration_and_asylum_en.pdf">EUCOM 17.6.</a>). That includes intra-EU relocation and, tied to it, the thorny matter of debarkation.</p>

	<h2>EU &amp; BORDER SURVEILLANCE</h2>

	<p>In April, the Commission submitted a proposal to the Council and to Parliament summarizing the various aspects of border surveillance and proposing improved <strong>FRONTEX rules</strong> for the conduct of <strong>Joint Operations at sea</strong> (<a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2013:0197:FIN:EN:PDF&amp;">EUCOM 12.4.</a>). The emphasis, inspired by the ECtHR ruling on Hirsi v. Italy, is on strengthening the basic rights of migrants. There is no mention of the disembarkation problem, however. Parliament debated the Commission proposal twice (<a href="http://barbara-lochbihler.de/1/presse/mitteilungen/eu-grenzschutzagentur-strukturelle-probleme-bei-frontex-nicht-geloest.html">BE 16.5.</a>, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2013/06/06/frontex-should-respect-rights-even-high-seas">HRW 6.6.</a>); a final decision is expected in September. Council and Parliament are also in the process of amending <strong>EUROSUR</strong> guidelines. The aim is to improve national cooperation in border surveillance, including the continued development of <strong>'smart borders'</strong>. No details have been published as yet. A provisional agreement between the two bodies has been reached (<a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/pressroom/content/20130530IPR10806/html/Eurosur-Parliament-and-Council-agree-on-new-border-surveillance-system">EUPL 30.5.</a>, <a href="http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/en/jha/137471.pdf">EUCL 14.6.</a>). Here, too, a decision is expected in the fall. In January, and as part of the EU's <strong>Common Security and Defence Policy</strong>, the Foreign Affairs Council created a (civilian) <strong>Integrated Border Management Assistance Mission</strong> (EUBAM) to be operative in Libya (<a href="http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/EN/foraff/135155.pdf">EUCL 31.1.</a>).</p>

	<h2>MIGRANT SMUGGLING</h2>

	<p>Migrant smuggling takes different forms. The relatively <strong>isolated</strong> arrivals from the 'East' suggest the existence of individual 'entrepreneurs'. The massive 'waves' of sub-Saharan Africans during short periods of time indicate more organized forms of 'facilitation'. As usual, there are numerous <strong>Italian reports</strong> about smuggler arrests (<a href="http://firenze.repubblica.it/cronaca/2013/01/15/news/passaporti_falsi_e_arresti_sulle_rotte_dell_immigrazione-50575157/?ref=search">Rep 15.1.</a>, <a href="http://corrieredelmezzogiorno.corriere.it/palermo/notizie/cronaca/2013/8-maggio-2013/sbarchi-immigrati-fermati-4-scafisti-2121036060383.shtml">CdM 8.5.</a>, <a href="http://www.ansa.it/web/notizie/collection/regioni_sicilia/06/02/Immigrazione-arrestati-quattro-scafisti_8805585.html">ANSA 2.6.</a>) and about juridical prosecutions (<a href="http://www.ansa.it/web/notizie/regioni/sicilia/2013/02/14/Immigrazione-Boarding-pass-arresto_8244781.html">ANSA 14.2</a>., <a href="http://palermo.repubblica.it/cronaca/2013/03/04/news/immigrati_morti_nella_stiva_scafisti_condannati_a_8_anni-53859956/?ref=search">Rep 4.3</a>.). Similar news emanates from <strong>Malta.</strong> In March three Mali nationals were convicted of organizing a failed escape of 25 migrants to Italy in 2010 (<a href="http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20130313/local/jail-for-malian-men-who-helped-migrants-try-to-leave.461306">ToM 13.3.</a>). In addition, a Maltese national faced trial for organizing a fatal voyage in 2006 (<a href="http://www.maltatoday.com.mt/en/newsdetails/news/courtandpolice/Two-to-face-trial-by-jury-for-aiding-and-abetting-illegal-immigrants-20130625">MT 25.6.</a>). Migrant smuggling to Italy is a Maltese reality, and one wonders why not more cases are detected and prosecuted.</p>

	<h2>PHOTOS AND VIDEOS</h2>

	<p>There is a growing availability of <strong>photos and videos</strong> about SAR operations. The main source is <em>La Repubblica</em> (<a href="http://video.repubblica.it/dossier/emergenza-lampedusa-2010/lampedusa-128-migranti-soccorsi-dalla-guardia-costiera/132205/130726?ref=search">Rep 17.6.</a>, <a href="http://video.repubblica.it/dossier/emergenza-lampedusa-2010/lampedusa-97-migranti-soccorsi-dalla-guardia-costiera/132506/131026?ref=search">Rep 19.6.</a>), but the Maltese media, too, are beginning to make use of visual information (<a href="http://www.maltatoday.com.mt/en/newsdetails/news/courtandpolice/82-migrants-intercepted-off-Malta-20130329">MT 29.3.</a>). The importance of such material must not be underestimated. Films and pictures show how difficult it can be to rescue migrants in distress at sea. Coast Guard crews often try to prevent the worst – panics, stampedes and the capsizing of entire boats. Images can also help in the search for <strong>missing 'harragas'</strong>, as a list of eight unresolved cases published by <em>Storie migranti</em> demonstrates (<a href="http://www.storiemigranti.org/spip.php?article1054">StM 20.7.</a>). Some pictures allow family members to trace the routes taken by missing sons. The eight stories also show that the use (by migrants) of mobile and satellite phones can facilitate tracing.</p>

	<h2>DATA QUALITY</h2>

	<p>As usual, the most reliable information stems from the <strong>Maltese government</strong>. Official figures indicate that 310 migrants arrived during the first semester; my count is exactly the same (<a href="http://www.maltatoday.com.mt/en/newsdetails/news/national/310-migrants-reached-Malta-since-January-20130624">MT 24.6.</a> <strong>UNHCR</strong> headquarters report 600 Malta arrivals, which is wrong and confirms a tendency in some organizations to publish figures that are inflated (<a href="http://www.unhcr.org/51d6b8a56.html">HCR 5.7.</a>).</p>

	<p>The accuracy of figures about <strong>Italian arrivals</strong> can also vary, but some numbers are amazingly close. <strong>FRONTEX</strong>, covering the 'main' Central Mediterranean route (excluding Calabria and Apulia) reports 1'124 arrivals for the first quarter of this year (<a href="http://www.frontex.europa.eu/assets/Publications/Risk_Analysis/FRAN_Q1_2013.pdf">FRAN Q1 2013</a>). My count is 1'126! Other accounts are further apart. For the first six months of 2013 the <strong>Italian Interior Ministry</strong> speaks of 7'913 arrivals (<a href="http://www.ansa.it/web/notizie/regioni/sicilia/2013/06/29/Immigrazione-raddoppiati-sbarchi-2013_8948517.html">ANSA 29.6.</a>). <strong>UNHCR</strong> mentions 7'800 (<a href="http://www.unhcr.org/51d6b8a56.html">HCR 5.7.</a>), and <strong>boat4people</strong> reports 7'200 (<a href="http://www.boats4people.org/index.php/fr/actualite/actuarticles/604-lampedusa-juin-transfert-naufrage">b4p 24.6.</a>). My count is a mere 6'455! It is possible, of course, that the media on which I rely do not report all landings, but can they miss 1'500, most of which must have occurred during the second quarter?</p>

	<p>The comments below refer to the year 2011, are based on the chronology and purposely kept short.</p>

	<h2>PROBLEMS</h2>

	<p>There are "blue" and there are "green" borders - maritime and land borders. Some <strong>problems</strong> the two have in common, but there are issues that <strong>separate</strong> them and that are <strong>typical</strong> of one or the other. This section begins with a few words about the difficulties they share. But, given the main focus of this web-site, I will then highlight a dozen problems typical of <strong>maritime</strong> borders and that migrants are likely to encounter when crossing the Central Mediterranean. To illustrate the difficulties examples of the year 2011 will be mentioned.</p>

	<h2>COMMON PROBLEMS</h2>

	<p>The problems <strong>commonly</strong> encountered by migrants are well-known. They have been studied by research institutes, International Organizations, NGOs and governments. Such investigations discuss the "push and pull" factors driving modern migrants, the general problems they run into when crossing borders and the issues typical of "mixed migration".</p>

	<p>In 2011, the International Catholic Migration Commission (<a href="http://www.icmc.net/article/icmc-publishes-study-legal-obligations-and-responses-boat-people-arriving-across-mediterrane">ICMC</a>) presented a particularly relevant report on <strong>boatpeople</strong> and on the <strong>post-arrival</strong> problems they encounter in Spain, Italy, Malta and Greece. The focus is on identification, status differentiation, legal counsel and protection. Special attention is paid to vulnerable persons like minors, victims of trafficking and of torture. The study also mentions possible <strong>solutions</strong> involving the European Union and the Council of Europe. The publication is highly pertinent but, by concentrating on post-arrival issues, the problems typical of blue border migration are not discussed.</p>

	<h2>BLUE-BORDER PROBLEMS</h2>

	<p>At times, the Mediterranean is relatively easy to cross; thousands make it without running into major problems. But the journey can be difficult; <strong>tragedies</strong> are common. In 2011, around 1500 boatpeople must have died. Search and Rescue (SAR) operations are therefore a central and <strong>typical</strong> aspect of blue border management.</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>Unfortunately, there are few informative and publicly available reports about such operations. Only the <em>Times of Malta</em>, based mostly on information supplied by the Armed Forces of Malta (AFM), makes it a habit to publish detailed accounts. Neither the Italian government nor FRONTEX supply us with comparable information. The reports illustrating the twelve problem areas discussed below are therefore Maltese. They are referred to in brackets and reproduced under <a href="images/Documents.pdf">Documents</a>.</p>

	<h2>(1) DESTINATIONS &amp; ROUTES</h2>
	<p> </p>
	<p>Short <strong>routes</strong> are relatively safe; most accidents occur on longer routes. – Another factor for choosing Lampedusa is more <strong>political</strong>. When landing on this island there is a high probability that migrants end up on the European continent. When arriving in Malta, that is unlikely. <a href="http://www.icmc.net/article/icmc-publishes-study-legal-obligations-and-responses-boat-people-arriving-across-mediterrane">ICMC interviews</a> of migrants confirm this fact: "Only 6% of those interviewed said that Malta had been their intended destination. Almost all stated that they had been hoping to arrive in another European country" (p. 68).</p>

	<h2>(2) DEPARTURES</h2>

	<p>In 2011, the reasons for leaving Libya and Tunisia varied, and the problems did, too. The Gaddafi government, to "flood" Europe with refugees, <strong>forcibly</strong> expelled thousands of sub-Saharan Africans. Others decided to <strong>flee</strong> from the on-going civil war. It meant the de facto end of the 2008 Italian-Libyan "Friendship Agreement" and the unfortunate "push-back" policy. It is hardly a surprise, therefore, that most of the 1500 victims were sub-Saharan Africans. The Tunisian situation was different. Young men, taking advantage of temporary governmental inactivity, departed for mainly <strong>economic reasons</strong>. Migrant <a href="index.php/links">interviews</a> show that both in Libya and Tunisia <strong>migrant smugglers</strong> facilitate departures and demand around 1000 USD per person and trip.  </p>

	<h2>(3) VESSELS</h2>

	<p>The use of engine-driven <strong>fishing boats </strong>is common, but some migrants travel in <strong>rubber dinghies </strong>or in private <strong>sailing boats </strong>[9 April, 11/14 November]. Given the large number of boats arriving there seems to be no shortage of supply and possibly some form of organized trade. The size and the quality of fishing boats can vary greatly. Many are small and in precarious shape. Engine problems and leaks are relatively frequent. <strong>Navigation</strong>, by contrast, seems to be a minor problem. This is surprising given the fact that most migrants have no maritime experience.</p>

	<h2>(4) DISTRESS</h2>

	<p>A frequent reason for distress (and for capsizing) is <strong>overcrowding</strong>, especially in rough seas [6/7 April]. <strong>Technical</strong> problems include engine failures [9 April, 30 May, 11 June, 14 July], gas shortages [6/7 April], rudder problems [9 May] and leaks [8/9 April, 1 May]. There are also cases of <strong>disorientation</strong> [9/13/29 May, 11 November]. <strong>Medical</strong> problems include dehydration, asphyxiation and pregnancies. Actual distress can be difficult to identify [8/9 May]. Is a request for gas a case of distress, and what is the appropriate reaction? Is a leak real or an excuse for getting help [2 May]?  Should such boats be intercepted and rescued or simply surveilled and escorted [1/8/9/13 May, 11 June]?</p>

	<h2>(5) DETECTION &amp; COMMUNICATION</h2>

	<p>Migrants tend to employ modern means of communication. The use of satellite phones becomes more and more common [6/30 April, 13 May, 11 November]. Such gadgets can facilitate SAR operations, but they can also complicate matters because messages may arrive from different quarters. Some migrants contact SAR Coordination Centers <strong>directly </strong>[6 April, 11/14 November], but many calls are <strong>indirect</strong>. SAR coordinators may be informed by friends of migrants living in North Africa, in Europe or in detention facilities [6/7 April]. They may also get calls from radio stations [14 November] or commercial and military ships [11 June]. Another information source is systematic SAR monitoring and air surveillance [13 May, 11 June]. Along the Italian coast, and to prevent criminal trafficking, the Guardia di Finanza engages in systematic interception and <strong>policing</strong>. The multitude of actors and communication channels demands careful coordination.</p>

	<h2>(6) SAR REGIONS &amp; COORDINATION</h2>

	<p>The obligation for coordination lies with the various Maritime Rescue Coordination Centers (MRCC). They are constituent parts of Maritime Search and Rescue Regions (MSRR). Both centers and regions are regulated by international law, the SOLAS (or Safety of Life at Sea) Convention of 1974 and the SAR (or Hamburg) Convention of 1979 [30 May, 4 June, 14/15 July]. It often happens that one state manages <strong>coordination</strong> and that a different state handles the <strong>rescue </strong>[29/30 May, 1/11 June, 11 November]. It is not uncommon for SAR units (Coast guard boats, helicopters and airplanes) to be assisted by <strong>military ships </strong>[13/14 May, 11 June, 14 July, 11/14 November] and by private <strong>fishing</strong> [6 April] and merchant vessels [30 April, 1 May].</p>


	<h2>(7) MEDITERRANEAN SAR REGIONS</h2>

	<p>Malta has a huge SAR Region [8 April]. Virtually all boatpeople pass through it, and the island of Lampedusa is located <strong>within</strong> the Maltese region. Malta is thus the Central Mediterranean's <strong>chief coordinator </strong>– but not its chief rescuer! The reason is that most incidents are closer to Italy (Lampedusa), Libya and Tunisia and that all three countries have more rescue assets than Malta [8 April]. The <strong>interplay</strong> of coordination and of rescue can be complicated, particularly when units of the US 6<sup>th</sup> Fleet, NATO and FRONTEX are involved [6/7/30 April, 1/13/14 May, 11 June, 11 November]. Concerted action is called for – but it can also fail.  </p>

	<h2>(8) COORDINATION/RESCUE DISPUTES</h2>

	<p>Italy accuses Malta with some regularity of "neglecting its obligations". Italy maintains that the Maltese, within their SAR Region, are responsible for both coordination <strong>and</strong> rescue, even in cases where boats are closer to Lampedusa than to Malta. The Maltese disagree. They argue that the "nearest" vessel (commercial and governmental) is responsible for rescue, and that persons rescued must be taken to the "nearest" place of safety (or port of call) [7/8/9 April, 30 May, June 1/4]. Both states claim that their positions are grounded in international maritime law (i.e. the SOLAS and SAR Conventions). As a number of incidents show, such disputes ultimately revolve around the issue of <strong>disembarkation</strong>.</p>


	<h2>(9) COORDINATION/RESCUE INCIDENTS</h2>

	<p style="margin-left: 30px;">In 2011, the two legal positions, and the issue of disembarkation, were at the core of several incidents. Some cases, involving Italy and Malta directly, were limited to mutual <strong>accusations </strong>[7/8/19 April, 29/30 May, 1/7/9 June]; other cases had political and diplomatic <strong>consequences</strong> [19 April, 1/2/3 May, 30 May/1 June]. In two instances Italy <strong>retaliated</strong> by blocking the disembarkation of migrants rescued by Maltese SAR units [9/19 April]. In two cases it was the <strong>UNHCR</strong> that accused Malta of neglecting its duties [10 May, 14 November]. At one point a Spanish <strong>NATO </strong>ship was caught in a complicated disembarkation tangle at the end of which the migrants were taken to Tunisia [14/15 July].</p>


	<h2>(10) RESCUE</h2>

	<p>Rescues can be difficult, especially in rough seas. Collisions, panics, stampedes and <strong>capsizing</strong> must be avoided. Cautious transfers, including the use of rubber dinghies, are often a necessity [6/7/9 April]. When mid-sea transfers are impossible life jackets and life boats may have to be dropped from the air [6/7 April]. Helicopters are used to handle medical emergencies. There are also reports about <strong>rescue refusals</strong>. Help by <strong>fishermen</strong> and <strong>merchant ships</strong> is rare because, unfortunately, they face various types of disincentives. The same may be true of military vessels. The British Guardian blamed <strong>NATO</strong> for neglecting its rescue obligations off Libya at the end of March. To investigate the accusations a committee of the European Council's Parliamentary Assembly (PACE) appointed a special rapporteur [8/9/10 May].</p>

	<h2>(11) SAR ASSETS</h2>

	<p>The assets available for SAR operations are unevenly distributed. <strong>Italy</strong>, with its well-equipped Guardia Costiera and Guardia di Finanza, is in a position to muster a respectable number of boats and airplanes. The <strong>Tunisian</strong> and <strong>Libyan</strong> navies, too, possess a fair number of ships. In comparison, Malta's assets are modest – one off-shore patrol boat and only a handful of in-shore boats and airplanes. That, however, does not prevent the AFM from operating in their entire SAR region [30 April]. Although the total number of assets existing in the Central Mediterranean is respectable, <strong>actual availability </strong>can be a problem, especially when several rescues have to be conducted simultaneously [7/30 April, 13 May, 1 June].</p>

	<h2>(12) DISEMBARKATION</h2>

	<p>The SOLAS and the SAR Conventions do not mention disembarkation. They merely state that the persons rescued must be taken to a "place of safety". It is the 2004 amendments to the SAR Convention (including the relevant Guidelines and a 2009 Circular) that mention disembarkation explicitly – but without settling the issue of responsibility. States are merely urged "to cooperate" in determining an appropriate place of disembarkation [June 4]. Italy accepts the 2004 amendments; Malta rejects them [8 April]. Malta also rejects the FRONTEX guidelines which stipulate that disembarkation is the responsibility of the state "hosting a mission". The legal gap remains: There is a sacrosanct duty to rescue, but there is no corresponding duty to receive the persons rescued. </p>

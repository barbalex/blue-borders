	<p>The comments below refer to the year 2011, are based on the chronology and purposely kept short.</p>

	<h2>SOLUTIONS</h2>

	<p>Problems call for solutions. Some blue-border problems can be handled <strong>unilaterally </strong>by the governments concerned. Lampedusa is an example where the Italian government is primarily called upon to act. The fight against trafficking, too, is largely a <strong>national </strong>domain. Other problems call for <strong>multilateral </strong>action. Examples are improvements in SAR cooperation, the resolution of disembarkation disputes or the provision of sufficient rescue assets.</p>

	<p>In numerous cases the involvement of international organizations like the UNHCR or the IMO is also required. Many solutions are therefore a <strong>combination</strong> of national, bilateral and multilateral measures. And, unfortunately, some answers are partial and unsatisfactory rather than comprehensive and sustainable. The discussion that follows builds, once again, on the 2011 events enumerated earlier and is no effort to be truly comprehensive.</p>

	<h2>EUROPE</h2>

	<p>First and foremost, workable solutions have to involve the nations on both sides of the Mediterranean, but the role of the <strong>European Union </strong>is also important. Blue-border management must be an all-European concern. So far, the Union's reaction is disappointing. <strong>Cecilia Malmström</strong>, the EU Commissioner for Home Affairs, is candid about this. In early 2012, she published an article in the <em>Times of Malta</em> summarizing the EU's refugee performance. Its title: "<a href="http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20120119/opinion/Refugees-How-Europe-failed.402977">How Europe Failed</a>"! The need for solidarity, she says, is on everyone's lips but there is a minimum of corresponding action.</p>

	<h2>LAMPEDUSA</h2>

	<p>To declare Lampedusa an "unsafe port" is no solution. Italy cannot prevent immigrants from heading for this island. In the short run a <strong>national</strong> solution must be found. At the very least, the Italian government has to provide <strong>ferries </strong>for orderly relocation. In addition, the <strong>reception facilities </strong>must be repaired to handle a regular flow of migrants; which should help to prevent protests and riots. Similar recommendations are part of a <a href="http://assembly.coe.int/CommitteeDocs/2011/amahlarg03_REV2_2011.pdf">report</a> published on 30 September by a special Committee of the Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly (PACE).</p>

	<p>If necessary, Italy can count on <strong>FRONTEX support</strong>. In the Spring of 2011, the organization sent specialists from other Schengen countries to help with the screening and debriefing of migrants. Their main task was to gather information about <strong>national origin </strong>and <strong>organized trafficking</strong>.</p>

	<h2>REPATRIATION</h2>

	<p>Another Italian problem to be eliminated is <strong>wholesale air repatriation</strong>. The arrangement seems to be part of an agreement Silvio Berlusconi signed on 6 April with the new<strong> Tunisian </strong>government. On 1 May, Italy announced that the scheme was working. Return flights were kept secret – by both governments. Only the large air operations following the September Lampedusa riots could not be kept under cover. It is not uncommon for European governments to sign bilateral migration agreements regulating repatriation. But, in many cases, the arrangement is made public. The details of the April 6 agreement, however, are unknown.</p>

	<h2>PUSH-BACK</h2>

	<p>The war in Libya meant the de facto end of Italy's contoversial <strong>push-back </strong>policy. The conflict ended in October but, as early as 17 June, the Berlusconi government signed a new migration agreement with the NTC. No details were published. On 23 August, and again on 3 October, Italy took another step and announced its intention to "update" the Friendship Agreement of 2008. The new Foreign Minister, Giulio Terzi, followed suit. He, too, called for a "reactivation" of the 2008 treaty.</p>

	<p>On 6 December, the Libyan provisional government (NTC) declared its willingness to pursue a migration policy "different" from past. It is to be hoped that the new arrangement will end indiscriminate push-back activities and collective expulsion. Future agreements should be in conformity with international law, most particularly with the recent ECtHR decision in the case of "<a href="http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;documentId=901565&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649">Hirsi v. Italy</a>". And, to really improve the lot of migrants, new agreement with Libya and Tunisia must address the problem of <strong>migrant smuggling</strong>.</p>

	<h2>DISEMBARKATION</h2>

	<p>Disembarkation disputes interfere with a proper functioning of SAR operations and must be eliminated. In the short run, an amicable solution between Italy and Malta might help. But a permanent solution demands changes in international maritime law. To alter the SOLAS Convention is no simple matter. To obtain a universal consensus within the <strong>International Maritime Organization</strong> can take years. A lasting solution of the disembarkation dispute is not in sight. In the meantime, other and more indirect measures can help.</p>

	<h2>RESETTLEMENT</h2>

	<p>Resettlement efforts by UNHCR and IOM are an example. Since 2005, close to 1500 migrants have been relocated from Malta, over 800 of which went to the US, the rest to Canada and Europe. Those profiting are mainly from war-torn countries like Somalia and Eritrea. In conformity with international conventions they are granted <strong>international protection </strong>(or asylum) because their security is endangered at home. Relocations help to ease Maltese worries about too many migrants arriving at their shores.</p>

	<h2>EUREMA</h2>

	<p style="margin-left: 30px;">Another <strong>resettlement</strong> effort is intra-European. In 2009, the EU Commission initiated a program called <strong>EUREMA </strong>(European Relocation Malta). It met with some success. By the end of 2011, 360 refugees have been resettled. At the most recent pledging conference in May 2011, thirteen EU countries declared their readiness to accept Maltese asylum seekers. Two non-EU countries, Norway and Switzerland, also participate. EUREMA was started because the EU was unable to activate the Refugee Solidarity Mechanism under the Council's 2001 Temporary Protection Directive. Prompted by Maltese insistence, the Commission launched EUREMA as a voluntary <strong>pilot project</strong>, hoping it might become part of a more comprehensive scheme.</p>

	<h2>COMMON EUROPEAN ASYLUM SYSTEM</h2>

	<p>A more comprehensive resettlement scheme is in the making - as part of the <strong>Common European Asylum System</strong> (CEAS). As early as 1999, the European Council agreed to establish a common asylum system based on the full application of the Geneva (UNHCR) Convention of 1951. Simply put, the objective is to harmonize 27 different asylum policies and to implement a general scheme of burden-sharing. The arrangement is broadly conceived and ambitious. Over the years, the EU has created a number of legal and financial instruments. Much remains to be done, however. A joint resettlement scheme is planned for the year 2012 - but may be difficult to realize.</p>

	<h2>EUROPEAN ASYLUM SUPPORT OFFICE</h2>

	<p>A recently established component of the future asylum system is the <strong>European Asylum Support Office</strong> (EASO). The agency was set up in June 2011, with headquarters in Valletta, Malta. Its task, as the name indicates, is to support national governments in the implementation of common asylum standards, accompanied by training and related activities. The assistance provided should improve asylum procedures in general.  EASO's impact on disembarkation is at best indirect, of course.</p>

	<h2>FRONTEX</h2>

	<p>In 2011, the EU also decided to <strong>strengthen FRONTEX</strong>. On 23 June, Council and Parliament agreed on a number of improvements in the areas of mission management, personnel recruitment, equipment, training, human rights protection and accountability. The intention is to make FRONTEX a more effective instrument to ease the burden of individual countries. Push-back practices will be abandoned. To guarantee the respect for basic rights future FRONTEX missions will be monitored by a fundamental rights officer.</p>

	<p>Unfortunately, the <strong>disembarkation </strong>rules remain unchanged. FRONTEX regulations still demand that rescued persons be disembarked in the country "hosting" a joint operation. For Malta this is unacceptable. It did not host a FRONTEX mission in 2011, and neither did its naval units participate in missions hosted by other countries. In early March, FRONTEX director <strong>Ilkka Laitinen </strong>visited Malta for discussions – with no results. Changing the Dublin "first country" rule could be a useful step. It would ease the burden on smaller countries located at the external "Schengen" border. For the moment this is unlikely.</p>

	<h2>COUNCIL OF EUROPE</h2>

	<p>The Council of Europe<strong> </strong>also became active. Based on a <strong>report</strong> dated 1 June, the Parliamentary Assembly (PACE) adopted a <a href="http://assembly.coe.int/Mainf.asp?link=/Documents/AdoptedText/ta11/ERES1821.htm">resolution</a> on 21 June dealing with important issues of blue-border migration. The main focus is on "Interception and Rescue at Sea of Asylum Seekers, Refugees and Irregular Migrants". A number of problem areas are discussed, in particular the rescue obligation, the non-refoulement principle, disembarkation rules and the need for solidarity. The resolution also formulates a handful of <a href="http://assembly.coe.int/Mainf.asp?link=/Documents/AdoptedText/ta11/EREC1974.htm">recommendations</a>. As is to be expected, these are predominantly a reminder of the legal obligations members have entered into.</p>

	<p>As mentioned above, a special PACE committee did an investigation on the situation at Lampedusa. In June, the same committee appointed a rapporteur to investigate the "lives lost in the Mediterranean since January 2011" and to determine legal <strong>responsibilities</strong>. In the meantime it became apparent that the rapporteur is concentrating her efforts on a single incident – the alleged refusal of NATO ships to rescue boatpeople in distress off Libya in late March. The results are not yet out. Most likely this effort, too, will end by reminding states of their legal duties.</p>

	<h2>SUMMARY STATEMENT</h2>

	<p>There were, by my count, 38'000 <strong>arrivals</strong> in 2013, roughly three times more than in 2012 (<a href="index.php/events-2013/arrivals-2013">Arrivals 2013</a>). But there were fewer than in 2011, when 47'000 migrants crossed the Central Mediterranean. Until the end of September, it looked as if the number of <strong>victims</strong> might be limited, but two <strong>massive accidents</strong> on 3 and 11 October brought the overall total to 766. The EU Commission reacted by creating a <strong>'Task Force Mediterranean'</strong> mandated to submit a report by the end of the year. The paper contains 38 recommendations, none of which are really new. <strong>Libya</strong> and <strong>Tunisia</strong> are still in political transition―but with an important difference. In Tunisia governmental institutions are functioning; in Libya they are not. Which explains why Libya is still a major <strong>transit country</strong> for East Africans and, increasingly, for Syrians. The main arrival <strong>destinations</strong>, as usual, are Sicily and Lampedusa, but also Calabria, Apulia and Malta.</p>

	<h2>ARRIVALS &amp; DESTINATIONS</h2>

	<p>As Graphs 1 and 2 indicate, the arrival pattern was <strong>highly uneven</strong>. Of the 38'000 migrants only 6'765 reached our shores during the first half of the year; during the second six months the number jumped to 31'228! The <strong>3rd quarter</strong> was the busiest, with 19'594 arrivals, followed by the <strong>4th quarter</strong> with 11'634. Given the usual autumn storms, hardly anyone arrived from 10 to 30 November. Graph 2 also shows the impact on <strong>destinations</strong>. Most landings, for the entire year, were in <strong>Southern Italy</strong> (23'094), more precisely in Sicily, Calabria and Apulia. <strong>Lampedusa</strong> saw 12'906 arrivals, <strong>Malta</strong> 1993. Roughly the same pattern prevailed during the 3rd and 4th quarters.</p>

	<h2>DEPARTURE AREAS</h2>

	<p>Looking at the entire year, 28'334 migrants arrived from <strong>Libya</strong>, 9'307 from the <strong>'East'</strong> and 352 from <strong>Tunisia </strong>(<a href="index.php/events-2013/arrivals-2013">Arrivals &amp; Departure Areas</a>). An identical pattern prevailed during each of the four quarters, as Graph 3 indicates. The Tunisian figure is extremely low, down from 1'895 in 2012. It is a clear sign that migrants are finding it difficult to depart from Tunisia. Even Tunisian 'harragas' may choose to depart from Libya rather than from their own country. In fact, with its 28'334 departures in 2013, <strong>Libya</strong> has become a highly attractive <strong>transit country</strong>. In 2012 the number was 6'400. The largest groups are now Syrians, followed by East Africans from Eritrea and Somalia. In its November report for Libya the UNHCR mentions 16'000 registered Syrians, compared with 3'300 Eritreans and 1'900 Somalis (<a href="http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/home/opendocPDFViewer.html?docid=4c907ffe9&amp;query=Fact-sheet%20Libya">Fact-sheet UNHCR Libya November 2013</a>).</p>

	<img class='img-responsive center-block' src="../images/2013/graph_6_2013.jpg" alt="graph 6_2013"/>

	<p>Departures from the <strong>'East'</strong> are up as well, jumping from 2'333 in 2012 to 9'307. And, as is to be expected, the difference of 7'000 migrants is in large part due to Syrian nationals. They tend to land in Calabria and Apulia, although as mentioned above, many depart from Libya and arrive in Sicily. As usual, 'Eastern' arrivals also include Afghans, Pakistanis, Iraqis and some Egyptians.</p>

	<h2>VICTIMS</h2>

	<p>Up to the end of September, there were 141 victims (dead and missing). This figure was modest, given the high number of arrivals. One of the reasons was improvement in the interplay of <strong>coordination</strong>, <strong>rescue</strong> and <strong>disembarkation</strong>. In other words, SAR disputes between Italy and Malta were largely avoided. It also helped that more merchant ships helped than in previous years. There were four such rescues during a single week in August involving a total of 670 migrants (<a href="http://www.ansa.it/web/notizie/regioni/sicilia/2013/08/04/Somali-raccontano-3-donne-morte-mare_9116528.html">ANSA 4.8.</a>, <a href="http://www.ansa.it/web/notizie/regioni/sicilia/2013/08/05/Oltre-300-migranti-largo-Libia_9118698.html">ANSA 5.8.</a>, <a href="http://agrigento.blogsicilia.it/soccorsi-migranti-al-largo-di-lampedusa/204107/">BS 6.8.</a>, <a href="http://www.ansa.it/web/notizie/regioni/sicilia/2013/08/08/Immigrazione-racconto-naufraghi-2-morti_9132095.html">ANSA 8.8.</a>). Unfortunately, the positive picture changed during the first ten days of October, when in <strong>two tragic accidents</strong> at least 600 migrants died. The annual total jumped to 766, double the number reported in 2012 (309 victims). The two accidents shared certain similarities: The boats departed from Libya, headed for Lampedusa and were completely overloaded. But there were major differences (<a href="http://palermo.repubblica.it/cronaca/2014/01/11/foto/il_mare_come_cimitero_dei_barconi_le_foto_delle_carrette_abbandonate-75615402/1/?ref=search#2">photos Rep</a>).</p>

	<h2>TWO ACCIDENTS</h2>

	<p>The first accident occurred on <strong>3 October 2013</strong> just one NM off Lampedusa. Because of engine failure, the migrants lit a blanket soaked with gasoline in an attempt to signal their location. But the fire spread, people rushed to one side – and the boat capsized (<a href="http://palermo.repubblica.it/cronaca/2013/10/03/news/lampedusa_naufraga_barcone_dopo_incendio_82_vittime_fra_loro_donna_incinta_e_2_bambini_ma_mancano_all_appello_250_persone-67793321/">Rep 3.10.</a>, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24392732">BBC 4.10.</a>, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24407568">BBC 5.10.</a>). It all happened very quickly. There was no time to organize an effective SAR operation (<a href="http://migrantsatsea.wordpress.com/2013/10/04/lampedusa-300-or-more-dead-in-latest-accident-what-can-be-done-to-stop-migrant-deaths-at-sea/">MaS 4.10.</a>). A total of 155 Eritreans could be rescued, largely by informal means; 366 drowned in sight of the shore.</p>

	<p>The second accident happened on <strong>10 October</strong>, but its causes are not as clear. Two boats sent out distress signals from a location 60 NM south of Lampedusa. Some survivors alleged that the boats had been fired upon by 'the Libyans' and began to take on water. Although 120 NM away from Malta, the migrants were within the Maltese coordination zone. An AFM airplane spotted the vessels, and the Maritime Squadron rescued 147; Italy managed to save 56 (<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24499890">BBC 11.10.</a>). Around 250 were reported missing. According to press accounts, the problem was coordination. Some journalists blamed Italy (<a href="http://www.maltatoday.com.mt/en/newsdetails/news/national/Lampedusa-tragedy-Italian-navy-failed-to-effect-instant-faster-rescue-20131130">MT 1.12.</a></span>), others found fault with the Maltese (<a href="http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2013-12-15/news/lampedusa-tragedy-a-case-of-political-bravado-gone-wrong-3465871382/">MInd 16.12.</a>, <a href="http://www.maltatoday.com.mt/en/newsdetails/news/national/Italian-navy-should-have-effected-immediate-rescue-says-former-AFM-commander-20131218">MT 18.12.</a>). No final judgment is possible – so far.</p>

	<h2>'MARE NOSTRUM'</h2>

	<p>The two accidents made headlines, and the Italian government reacted quickly – and effectively (<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24515906">BBC 14.10.</a>). Within days Italy initiated an operation called <strong>'Mare Nostrum' </strong>(<a href="http://www.marina.difesa.it/_Layouts/MMIV2-Layouts/pages/MMI.GalleriaFullscreen.aspx?PageId=26759112-b116-485d-b549-ba90fcbb6bfe&amp;Guid=0525d7b0-e550-4309-959d-47d4dcf68c76">photos</a>). The Italian navy, with ships and helicopters, was ordered to patrol the waters between Libya and Italy (<a href="http://www.ansa.it/web/notizie/regioni/sicilia/2013/10/18/Partita-oggi-operazione-Mare-Nostrum_9482193.html">ANSA 18.10.</a>, <a href="http://www.agrigentoflash.it/2013/10/19/naufragi-lampedusa-partita-loperazioone-mare-nostrum/">AF 19.10.</a>). The Guardia Costiera and the Guardia di Finanza, usually the main actors, assumed a subsidiary role. By the end of the year, the operation was still going on, and it has so far proved to be extremely effective. Although most rescues are closer to Lampedusa than to Sicily, disembarkations are usually in Sicilian harbors, at Pozzallo, Siracusa, Augusta and Catania.</p>

	<h2>'TASK FORCE MEDITERRANEAN'</h2>

	<p>The European Union reacted as well. Commissioner Malmström was 'deeply saddened' and promised action (<a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-13-849_en.htm">EUCOM 3.10.</a>). At a meeting of the Justice and Home Affairs Council (JHA Council) Malmström demanded that FRONTEX play a larger role (<a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-13-864_en.htm">EUCOM 8.10.</a>). In addition, and to suggest improvements, European Commission President Barroso announced the formation of a <strong>'Task Force Mediterranean' </strong>(<a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_SPEECH-13-858_en.htm">EUCOM 25.10.</a>). The result was a paper containing 38 different suggestions submitted at the JHA Council meeting of early December (<a href="http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/what-is-new/news/news/docs/20131204_communication_on_the_work_of_the_task_force_mediterranean_en.pdf">EUCOM 4.12.</a>, <a href="http://www.maltatoday.com.mt/en/newsdetails/news/national/Migration-task-force-identifies-38-actions-to-address-Mediterranean-flows-20131204">MT 4.12.</a>). It was a summary of what the EU was already doing; the tenor was 'more of the same'. At the December EU Summit the issue was also discussed but, as the <strong>final document</strong> shows, in a rather cursory fashion (<a href="http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/en/ec/140245.pdf">EUCL 20.12.</a>). The only concrete and effective innovation, as it turned out, was of a national character: Italy's 'Mare Nostrum'.</p>

	<h2>EUROSUR &amp; FRONTEX OPERATING RULES</h2>

	<p>The purpose of <strong>EUROSUR </strong>is to coordinate national efforts in border surveillance by creating an EU-wide data network. The <strong>regulations</strong> governing the scheme were approved in October, first by the EU Parliament (<a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/news-room/content/20131007IPR21624/html/EU-border-surveillance-MEPs-approve-Eurosur-operating-rules">EUPL 10.10.</a>) and then by the Council (<a href="http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/en/jha/139099.pdf">EUCJHA 22.10.</a>). EUROSUR became operative in early December (<a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-13-1182_en.htm">EUCOM 29.11.</a>).</p>

	<p>Redefining the <strong>FRONTEX rules</strong> guiding the conduct of <strong>Joint Operations at sea</strong> was another project. After the European Court of Justice rejected a first proposal in 2012, the Commission submitted a second proposal in April 2013 to both Council and Parliament (<a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2013:0197:FIN:EN:PDF&amp;">EUCOM 12.4.</a>). The emphasis, inspired by the Hirsi vs. Italy ruling of 2012, was on strengthening the basic rights of migrants. Parliament debated the proposal in May and June (<a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2013/06/06/frontex-should-respect-rights-even-high-seas">HRW 6.6.</a>) but there was no final decision. In October, six EU Mediterranean countries (Spain, France, Italy, Malta, Greece and Cyprus) rejected the proposal. One of the reasons was that the disembarkation issue remained unsolved. The 'host country' rule continues to prevail (<a href="http://www.ansa.it/ansamed/en/news/nations/italy/2013/10/15/Immigration-EU-Council-divided-FRONTEX-guidelines_9465146.html">ANSAmed 15.10.</a>, <a href="http://migrantsatsea.wordpress.com/2013/10/16/details-and-document-regarding-eu-mediterranean-states-opposition-to-proposed-frontex-sea-borders-regulation/">MaS 16.10.</a>).</p>

	<h2>'SEAHORSE MEDITERRANEO'</h2>

	<p>In September, the EU Commission organized a meeting in Madrid to discuss a maritime control program called<strong> 'Seahorse Mediterraneo' </strong>(<a href="http://www.ansamed.info/ansamed/en/news/sections/politics/2013/09/19/Immigration-Seahorse-Mediterraneo-border-control_9324814.html">ANSAmed 19.9.</a>, <a href="http://www.libyaherald.com/2013/09/22/eu-to-work-with-libya-to-stem-illegal-migrant-tide/#axzz2filaU4ZY">LH 22.9.</a>). The project is seen as an extension of </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; line-height: 115%;">'SEAHORSE Atlantico', an effort to manage migration on the EU's Atlantic borders and in operation since 2010. The arrangement includes Spain and Portugal on the EU side and countries ranging from Morocco to Guinea-Bissau on the African side. 'SEAHORSE Atlantico' combines maritime patrols with a system of high-tech border surveillance and proves to be effective (<a href="http://www.imp-med.eu/En/En/image.php?id=125">Guardia Civil</a>). The Commission's idea is to set up a similar network in the Mediterranean. States from both sides are meant to participate, amongst them Italy and Malta, Libya and Tunisia</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; line-height: 115%;">. The scheme is tied to EUROSUR and to EU Mobility Partnerships (<a href="http://ffm-online.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/tun-EU-mob-partnersch-2013-11-entw.pdf">EUCL 25.11.</a>).</p>

	<h2>PUSH-BACK</h2>

	<p>Push-backs, as practiced by Berlusconi and Gaddafi, were declared illegal in 2012. It was therefore surprising to hear newly elected Maltese PM Muscat announce in early July that push-backs might be resumed – if necessary (<a href="http://www.maltatoday.com.mt/en/newsdetails/news/national/Decisions-must-be-taken-to-safeguard-Maltese-interests-Prime-Minister-20130705">MT 5.7.</a>). It is true that Malta has the highest per-capita rate of asylum seekers in the EU, but given the ECtHR ruling, push-backs are no longer an acceptable method to reduce arrivals. The Court and Commissioner Malmström objected within days (<a href="http://www.maltatoday.com.mt/en/newsdetails/news/national/Government-does-not-exclude-sending-migrants-back-to-Libya-20130709">MT 9.7.</a>, <a href="http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20130709/local/brussels-warns-malta-that-push-backs-are-illegal.477302#.UtJHMd-A2M8">MT 9.7.</a>). President van Rompuy travelled to Malta (<a href="http://www.maltatoday.com.mt/en/newsdetails/news/national/Libya-deputy-PM-in-Malta-for-migration-talks-with-Van-Rompuy-20130711">MT 11.7.</a>), and to top it off, an impressive number of Maltese experts joined the critics (<a href="http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20130712/local/25-authors-in-statement-against-repatriation-of-migrants.477651#.UtJHx9-A2M8">ToM 12.7.</a>). After that, PM Muscat no longer mentioned push-backs as a possibility; he spoke instead of the need for greater EU burden-sharing.</p>

	<p>Although Italy discontinued maritime push-backs two years ago, there are regular reports of <strong>aerial push-backs of Egyptians</strong>. NGOs tell us that 19 Egyptians were flown back within two days of their arrival in August (<a href="http://siciliamigrants.blogspot.it/2013/08/der-stellvertretende-auenminister.html">SM 21.8.</a>, <a href="http://www.terrelibere.org/4677-da-catania-e-lamezia-profughi-egiziani-rispediti-all-inferno">telib 2.9.</a>) and that another 10 Egyptians were repatriated within two days in September (<a href="http://siciliamigranti.blogspot.ch/2013/09/non-si-fermano-i-rimpatri-verso-legitto.html">SM 11.9.</a>). In November, the UNHCR complained about similar practices (<a href="http://ffm-online.org/2013/11/14/unhcr-statement-zu-frontex-push-backs-www-unhcr-gr/">UNHCR 12.11.</a>), and a few days later the EU Ombudsman asked Italy to conduct an investigation. Critics also wonder whether the Italian-Libyan coast guard cooperation agreement, signed in October, makes any mention of push-back practices (<a href="http://corrieredelmezzogiorno.corriere.it/palermo/notizie/cronaca/2013/8-ottobre-2013/sbarchi-immigrati-guardacoste-libicipattuglieranno-insieme-italiani-2223447193766.shtml">CdM 8.10.</a>). FRONTEX has been accused at times of participating in Italian push-back operations. The new rules governing Return Operations, published in December, are meant to prevent such tactics (<a href="http://frontex.europa.eu/news/frontex-code-of-conduct-for-return-operations-published-x1a0c0">FRONTEX 9.12.</a>).</p>

	<h2>DATA QUALITY</h2>

	<p>The gap existing between the numbers released by the <strong>Italian Ministry of the Interior</strong> (the 'Viminale') and those underlying this website is narrowing. According to the Ministry, 42'925 migrants arrived 'on all coasts' during 2013. If the 1'842 Adriatic arrivals are deducted, the total for the Central Mediterranean is 41'083 (<a href="http://news.panorama.it/cronaca/immigrati-clandestini-lampedusa?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=tweet">Pan 3.1.14.</a>). My figure is 36'000 – or 14% lower. The discrepancy is relatively modest, given the different types of sources used. The numbers for <strong>Libyan departures</strong> are closer yet, although in this case my figure is somewhat higher. The Ministry mentions 27'314 migrants; my count is 28'334. The Ministry's nationality figures confirm that with 11'300 departures the Syrians are now the largest single group leaving from Libya, followed by 9'834 Eritreans and 3'263 Somalis (<a href="http://news.panorama.it/cronaca/immigrati-clandestini-lampedusa?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=tweet">Pan 3.1.14.</a>). Also, in early September Interior Minister Alfano indicated that up to then 6'920 migrants had landed in Sicily. My count is around 6'200. Again, the difference is minor (<a href="http://palermo.repubblica.it/cronaca/2013/09/06/news/immigrazione_alfano_a_siracusa_vertice_con_prefetti_e_capo_della_polizia-65998484/">Rep 6.9</a>.).</p>

	<p><strong>FRONTEX figures</strong>, as usual, are not as close. For the 1st quarter of 2013, the FRAN Q2 Report mentions 1'626 Central Mediterranean arrivals (including Calabria and Apulia); my count is 1'325. For the 2nd quarter the figure is 6'599; mine is 5'028. The differences range from 20% to almost 30% (<a href="http://frontex.europa.eu/assets/Publications/Risk_Analysis/FRAN_Q2_2013.pdf">FRAN Q2</a>). The figures on victims published by <strong>Fortress Europe</strong> used to be reliable and close to mine. Unfortunately, that is not the case for 2013. For some reason, the list is highly incomplete. It fails to mention 16 incidents, some of which are sizeable. </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; line-height: 115%;">Small wonder that the total number of victims for the Central Mediterranean is a mere 574 (<a href="http://fortresseurope.blogspot.ch/p/la-strage.html">Fortress Europe</a>), whereas my (conservative) count is 766. Finally, and most interestingly, there are an increasing number of SAR reports from <strong>Tunisia </strong>and <strong>Libya</strong>. From 1 July to 10 October there were ten reports from Tunisia, and from 9 July to 17 December there were eight reports from Libya.</p>

	<h2>Central Mediterranean</h2>

	<p>There are land or 'green' borders, and there are maritime or 'blue' borders. The focus of this website is on the latter - and on migration. The scope of the topic is immense. No one can deal seriously with all the maritime borders, with all of migration and with all the boatpeople of the world. I decided to concentrate on the Central Mediterranean, a 'quadrangle' delimited by Italy, Malta, Tunisia, and Libya. The decision is personal; I lived in Malta for three years and witnessed some of the problems firsthand. Thousands of migrants crossed this part of the Mediterranean in the past, and they will do so in the future. Given the political changes in North Africa, there are new problems – but there is also new hope.</p>

	<h2>Northern & Southern Rim</h2>

	<p>It is important to look at the situation from both sides of the Mediterranean. From a European perspective Italy and Malta are most heavily involved, but they cannot handle the situation alone. There is a need for increased cooperation. The European Union and the Council of Europe are trying to help, and some of their steps point in the right direction. But more will have to be done. There is also a need for better cooperation with (and among) the countries on the Southern rim. That, however, is difficult given different political developments. While Tunisia has become more democratic Libya is in a state of military and political turmoil.</p>

	<h2>Chronology of Events</h2>

	<p>The Central Mediterranean is only one of Europe's blue borders. But, as developments since the 'Arab Spring' have shown, it is a border marked by drama and by tragedy. The main purpose of this website is to take a closer look at the dynamics involved, beginning with the year 2011. Its core is a month-by-month chronology of blue-border events, accompanied by a number of statistics, commentaries and some background information. Another goal is to highlight the problems typical of maritime migration and to mention possible solutions. To do that a glance at the diplomatic, political and legal context of blue-border governance is important.</p>

	<h2>Overview</h2>

	<p>There is no lack of blue border information. The Internet contains masses of data, and there are numerous studies and publications by academics, NGOs and IOs. My goal is not to compete with these efforts. But, because the information is so plentiful, there is a need to see the wood for the trees. The purpose of this website is just that – to provide an overview by relating the particular to the more general. The effort should be especially useful for journalists, politicians, students and scholars or anyone trying to gain a quick and general impression.</p>

	<h2>Data Quality</h2>

	<p>Some of the data used are reliable, but at times information quality is a problem. One difficulty is availability: Crucial information is simply not accessible. Another problem is accuracy: Various sources report events and numbers in various ways. I try to minimize the worst of inaccuracies by using as many sources as the situation permits. For more details about data quality see my commentaries.</p>

	<h2>Limitations</h2>

	<p>The present website has certain limitations. The focus is on what happens at sea and not on land, on the dynamics typical of maritime migration. Mediterranean crossings are dangerous, which is why search and rescue (SAR) is an important topic. Issues of reception, redistribution and asylum, by contrast, are are not dealt with in detail. They are covered by other web-sites and by many studies. Also, there is no intention to focus on the often traumatic experience of individuals. That is the function of the press and of NGOs. Anyone interested in the accounts of SAR operations or of personal tragedies can do so by consulting the relevant online sources directly. Finally it is important to add that I do not intend to compete with experts in maritime law or in SAR operations.</p>

	<h2>Switzerland</h2>

	<p>Why should this website be edited in Switzerland, a country with green borders only and no direct access to the Mediterranean? The reason is that Switzerland became an associate member of the Schengen area in 2008. Although not in the EU, we are integrated when it comes to handling cross-border mobility. As a consequence, the country's responsibilities have widened - and may extend to the blue waters of the Mediterranean. Swiss border guards work for Frontex in various capacities, at headquarters in Warsaw but also in the field, including some harbors in Southern Italy. Changing realities call for new governmental activities.</p>
